Chapter 12  Debugging

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 80386 brings to Intel's line of microprocessors significant advances in
debugging power. The single-step exception and breakpoint exception of
previous processors are still available in the 80386, but the principal
debugging support takes the form of debug registers. The debug registers
support both instruction breakpoints and data breakpoints. Data breakpoints
are an important innovation that can save hours of debugging time by
pinpointing, for example, exactly when a data structure is being
overwritten. The breakpoint registers also eliminate the complexities
associated with writing a breakpoint instruction into a code segment
(requires a data-segment alias for the code segment) or a code segment
shared by multiple tasks (the breakpoint exception can occur in the context
of any of the tasks). Breakpoints can even be set in code contained in ROM.

12.1  Debugging Features of the Architecture

The features of the 80386 architecture that support debugging include:

Reserved debug interrupt vector

Permits processor to automatically invoke a debugger task or procedure when
an event occurs that is of interest to the debugger.

Four debug address registers

Permit programmers to specify up to four addresses that the CPU will
automatically monitor.

Debug control register

Allows programmers to selectively enable various debug conditions
associated with the four debug addresses.

Debug status register

Helps debugger identify condition that caused debug exception.

Trap bit of TSS (T-bit)

Permits monitoring of task switches.

Resume flag (RF) of flags register

Allows an instruction to be restarted after a debug exception without
immediately causing another debug exception due to the same condition.

Single-step flag (TF)

Allows complete monitoring of program flow by specifying whether the CPU
should cause a debug exception with the execution of every instruction.

Breakpoint instruction

Permits debugger intervention at any point in program execution and aids
debugging of debugger programs.

Reserved interrupt vector for breakpoint exception

Permits processor to automatically invoke a handler task or procedure upon
encountering a breakpoint instruction.

These features make it possible to invoke a debugger that is either a
separate task or a procedure in the context of the current task. The
debugger can be invoked under any of the following kinds of conditions:

  *  Task switch to a specific task.
  *  Execution of the breakpoint instruction.
  *  Execution of every instruction.
  *  Execution of any instruction at a given address.
  *  Read or write of a byte, word, or doubleword at any specified address.
  *  Write to a byte, word, or doubleword at any specified address.
  *  Attempt to change a debug register.

12.2  Debug Registers

Six 80386 registers are used to control debug features. These registers are
accessed by variants of the MOV instruction. A debug register may be either
the source operand or destination operand. The debug registers are
privileged resources; the MOV instructions that access them can only be
executed at privilege level zero. An attempt to read or write the debug
registers when executing at any other privilege level causes a general
protection exception. Figure 12-1 shows the format of the debug registers.

<A Name="12.2.1"><H2>12.2.1  Debug Address Registers (DRO-DR3)</H2>

12.2.1  Debug Address Registers (DR0-DR3)

Each of these registers contains the linear address associated with one of
four breakpoint conditions. Each breakpoint condition is further defined by
bits in DR7.

The debug address registers are effective whether or not paging is enabled.
The addresses in these registers are linear addresses. If paging is enabled,
the linear addresses are translated into physical addresses by the
processor's paging mechanism (as explained in Chapter 5). If paging is not
enabled, these linear addresses are the same as physical addresses.

Note that when paging is enabled, different tasks may have different
linear-to-physical address mappings. When this is the case, an address in a
debug address register may be relevant to one task but not to another. For
this reason the 80386  has both global and local enable bits in DR7. These
bits indicate whether a given debug address has a global (all tasks) or
local (current task only) relevance.

<HR>
<A Name="12.2.2"><H2>12.2.2  Debug Control Register (DR7)</H2>

12.2.2  Debug Control Register (DR7)

The debug control register shown in Figure 12-1 both helps to define the
debug conditions and selectively enables and disables those conditions.

For each address in registers DR0-DR3, the corresponding fields R/W0
through R/W3 specify the type of action that should cause a breakpoint. The
processor interprets these bits as follows:

   00 -- Break on instruction execution only
   01 -- Break on data writes only
   10 -- undefined
   11 -- Break on data reads or writes but not instruction fetches

Fields LEN0 through LEN3 specify the length of data item to be monitored. A
length of 1, 2, or 4 bytes may be specified. The values of the length fields
are interpreted as follows:

   00 -- one-byte length
   01 -- two-byte length
   10 -- undefined
   11 -- four-byte length

If RWn is 00 (instruction execution), then LENn should also be 00. Any other
length is undefined.

The low-order eight bits of DR7 (L0 through L3 and G0 through G3)
selectively enable the four address breakpoint conditions. There are two
levels of enabling: the local (L0 through L3) and global (G0 through G3)
levels. The local enable bits are automatically reset by the processor at
every task switch to avoid unwanted breakpoint conditions in the new task.
The global enable bits are not reset by a task switch; therefore, they can
be used for conditions that are global to all tasks.

The LE and GE bits control the "exact data breakpoint match" feature of the
processor. If either LE or GE is set, the processor slows execution so that
data breakpoints are reported on the instruction that causes them. It is
recommended that one of these bits be set whenever data breakpoints are
armed. The processor clears LE at a task switch but does not clear GE.

<A Name="12.2.3"><H2>12.2.3  Debug Status Register (DR6)</H2>

12.2.3  Debug Status Register (DR6)

The debug status register shown in Figure 12-1 permits the debugger to
determine which debug conditions have occurred.

When the processor detects an enabled debug exception, it sets the
low-order bits of this register (B0 thru B3) before entering the debug
exception handler. Bn is set if the condition described by DRn, LENn, and
R/Wn occurs. (Note that the processor sets Bn regardless of whether Gn or
Ln is set. If more than one breakpoint condition occurs at one time and if
the breakpoint trap occurs due to an enabled condition other than n, Bn may
be set, even though neither Gn nor Ln is set.)

The BT bit is associated with the T-bit (debug trap bit) of the TSS (refer
to 7 for the location of the T-bit). The processor sets the BT bit before
entering the debug handler if a task switch has occurred and the T-bit of
the new TSS is set. There is no corresponding bit in DR7 that enables and
disables this trap; the T-bit of the TSS is the sole enabling bit.

The BS bit is associated with the TF (trap flag) bit of the EFLAGS
register. The BS bit is set if the debug handler is entered due to the
occurrence of a single-step exception. The single-step trap is the
highest-priority debug exception; therefore, when BS is set, any of the
other debug status bits may also be set.

The BD bit is set if the next instruction will read or write one of the
eight debug registers and ICE-386 is also using the debug registers at the
same time.

Note that the bits of DR6 are never cleared by the processor. To avoid any
confusion in identifying the next debug exception, the debug handler should
move zeros to DR6 immediately before returning.

<A Name="12.2.4"><H2>12.2.4  Breakpoint Field Recognition</H2>

12.2.4  Breakpoint Field Recognition

The linear address and LEN field for each of the four breakpoint conditions
define a range of sequential byte addresses for a data breakpoint. The LEN
field permits specification of a one-, two-, or four-byte field. Two-byte
fields must be aligned on word boundaries (addresses that are multiples of
two) and four-byte fields must be aligned on doubleword boundaries
(addresses that are multiples of four). These requirements are enforced by
the processor; it uses the LEN bits to mask the low-order bits of the
addresses in the debug address registers. Improperly aligned code or data
breakpoint addresses will not yield the expected results.

A data read or write breakpoint is triggered if any of the bytes
participating in a memory access is within the field defined by a breakpoint
address register and the corresponding LEN field. Table 12-1 gives some
examples of breakpoint fields with memory references that both do and do not
cause traps.

To set a data breakpoint for a misaligned field longer than one byte, it
may be desirable to put two sets of entries in the breakpoint register such
that each entry is properly aligned and the two entries together span the
length of the field.

Instruction breakpoint addresses must have a length specification of one
byte (LEN = 00); other values are undefined. The processor recognizes an
instruction breakpoint address only when it points to the first byte of an
instruction. If the instruction has any prefixes, the breakpoint address
must point to the first prefix.

<A Name="12.3"><H2>12.3  Debug Exceptions</H2>

12.3  Debug Exceptions

Two of the interrupt vectors of the 80386 are reserved for exceptions that
relate to debugging. Interrupt 1 is the primary means of invoking debuggers
designed expressly for the 80386; interrupt 3 is intended for debugging
debuggers and for compatibility with prior processors in Intel's 8086
processor family.

<HR>
<A Name="12.3.1"><H2>12.3.1  Interrupt 1 -- Debug Exceptions</H2>

12.3.1  Interrupt 1 -- Debug Exceptions

The handler for this exception is usually a debugger or part of a debugging
system. The processor causes interrupt 1 for any of several conditions. The
debugger can check flags in DR6 and DR7 to determine what condition caused
the exception and what other conditions might be in effect at the same time.
Table 12-2 associates with each breakpoint condition the combination of
bits that indicate when that condition has caused the debug exception.

Instruction address breakpoint conditions are faults, while other debug
conditions are traps. The debug exception may report either or both at one
time. The following paragraphs present details for each class of debug
exception.

<HR>
<A Name="12.3.1.1"><H2>12.3.1.1  Instruction Address Breakpoint</H2>

12.3.1.1  Instruction Addrees Breakpoint

The processor reports an instruction-address breakpoint before it executes
the instruction that begins at the given address; i.e., an instruction-
address breakpoint exception is a fault.

The RF (restart flag) permits the debug handler to retry instructions that
cause other kinds of faults in addition to debug faults. When it detects a
fault, the processor automatically sets RF in the flags image that it pushes
onto the stack. (It does not, however, set RF for traps and aborts.)

When RF is set, it causes any debug fault to be ignored during the next
instruction. (Note, however, that RF does not cause breakpoint traps to be
ignored, nor other kinds of faults.)

The processor automatically clears RF at the successful completion of every
instruction except after the IRET instruction, after the POPF instruction,
and after a JMP, CALL, or INT instruction that causes a task switch. These
instructions set RF to the value specified by the memory image of the EFLAGS
register.

The processor automatically sets RF in the EFLAGS image on the stack before
entry into any fault handler. Upon entry into the fault handler for
instruction address breakpoints, for example, RF is set in the EFLAGS image
on the stack; therefore, the IRET instruction at the end of the handler will
set RF in the EFLAGS register, and execution will resume at the breakpoint
address without generating another breakpoint fault at the same address.

If, after a debug fault, RF is set and the debug handler retries the
faulting instruction, it is possible that retrying the instruction will
raise other faults. The retry of the instruction after these faults will
also be done with RF=1, with the result that debug faults continue to be
ignored. The processor clears RF only after successful completion of the
instruction.

Real-mode debuggers can control the RF flag by using a 32-bit IRET. A
16-bit IRET instruction does not affect the RF bit (which is in the
high-order 16 bits of EFLAGS). To use a 32-bit IRET, the debugger must
rearrange the stack so that it holds appropriate values for the 32-bit EIP,
CS, and EFLAGS (with RF set in the EFLAGS image). Then executing an IRET
with an operand size prefix causes a 32-bit return, popping the RF flag
into EFLAGS.

<HR>
<A Name="12.3.1.2"><H2>12.3.1.2  Data Address Breakpoint</H2>

12.3.1.2  Data Address Breakpoint

A data-address breakpoint exception is a trap; i.e., the processor reports
a data-address breakpoint after executing the instruction that accesses the
given memory item.

When using data breakpoints it is recommended that either the LE or GE bit
of DR7 be set also. If either LE or GE is set, any data breakpoint trap is
reported exactly after completion of the instruction that accessed the
specified memory item. This exact reporting is accomplished by forcing the
80386 execution unit to wait for completion of data operand transfers before
beginning execution of the next instruction. If neither GE nor LE is set,
data breakpoints may not be reported until one instruction after the data is
accessed or may not be reported at all. This is due to the fact that,
normally, instruction execution is overlapped with memory transfers to such
a degree that execution of the next instruction may begin before memory
transfers for the prior instruction are completed.

If a debugger needs to preserve the contents of a write breakpoint
location, it should save the original contents before setting a write
breakpoint. Because data breakpoints are traps, a write into a breakpoint
location will complete before the trap condition is reported. The handler
can report the saved value after the breakpoint is triggered. The data in
the debug registers can be used to address the new value stored by the
instruction that triggered the breakpoint.

<HR>
<A Name="12.3.1.3"><H2>12.3.1.3  General Detect Fault</H2>

12.3.1.3  General Detect Fault

This exception occurs when an attempt is made to use the debug registers at
the same time that ICE-386 is using them. This additional protection feature
is provided to guarantee that ICE-386 can have full control over the
debug-register resources when required. ICE-386 uses the debug-registers;
therefore, a software debugger that also uses these registers cannot run
while ICE-386 is in use. The exception handler can detect this condition by
examining the BD bit of DR6.

<HR>
<A Name="12.3.1.4"><H2>12.3.1.4  Single-Step Trap</H2>

12.3.1.4  Single-Step Trap

This debug condition occurs at the end of an instruction if the trap flag
(TF) of the flags register held the value one at the beginning of that
instruction.  Note that the exception does not occur at the end of an
instruction that sets TF. For example, if POPF is used to set TF, a
single-step trap does not occur until after the instruction that follows
POPF.

The processor clears the TF bit before invoking the handler.  If TF=1 in
the flags image of a TSS at the time of a task switch, the exception occurs
after the first instruction is executed in the new task.

The single-step flag is normally not cleared by privilege changes inside a
task.  INT instructions, however, do clear TF.  Therefore, software
debuggers that single-step code must recognize and emulate INT n or INTO
rather than executing them directly.

To maintain protection, system software should check the current execution
privilege level after any single step interrupt to see whether single
stepping should continue at the current privilege level.

The interrupt priorities in hardware guarantee that if an external
interrupt occurs, single stepping stops. When both an external interrupt and
a single step interrupt occur together, the single step interrupt is
processed first. This clears the TF bit. After saving the return address or
switching tasks, the external interrupt input is examined before the first
instruction of the single step handler executes.  If the external interrupt
is still pending, it is then serviced. The external interrupt handler is not
single-stepped. To single step an interrupt handler, just single step an INT
n instruction that refers to the interrupt handler.

<HR>
<A Name="12.3.1.5"><H2>12.3.1.5  Task Switch Breakpoint</H2>

12.3.1.5  Task Switch Breakpoint

The debug exception also occurs after a switch to an 80386 task if the
T-bit of the new TSS is set.  The exception occurs after control has passed
to the new task, but before the first instruction of that task is executed.
The exception handler can detect this condition by examining the BT bit of
the debug status register DR6.

Note that if the debug exception handler is a task, the T-bit of its TSS
should not be set. Failure to observe this rule will cause the processor to
enter an infinite loop.

<HR>
<A Name="12.3.2"><H2>12.3.2  Interrupt 3 -- Breakpoint Exception</H2>


12.3.2  Interrupt 3 -- Breakpoint Exception

This exception is caused by execution of the breakpoint instruction INT 3.
Typically, a debugger prepares a breakpoint by substituting the opcode of
the one-byte breakpoint instruction in place of the first opcode byte of the
instruction to be trapped. When execution of the INT 3 instruction causes
the exception handler to be invoked, the saved value of ES:EIP points to the
byte following the INT 3 instruction.

With prior generations of processors, this feature is used extensively for
trapping execution of specific instructions. With the 80386, the needs
formerly filled by this feature are more conveniently solved via the debug
registers and interrupt 1.  However, the breakpoint exception is still
useful for debugging debuggers, because the breakpoint exception can vector
to a different exception handler than that used by the debugger. The
breakpoint exception can also be useful when it is necessary to set a
greater number of breakpoints than permitted by the debug registers.
