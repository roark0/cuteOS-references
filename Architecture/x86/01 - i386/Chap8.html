  Chapter 8  Input/Output

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This chapter presents the I/O features of the 80386 from the following
perspectives:

  *  Methods of addressing I/O ports

  *  Instructions that cause I/O operations

  *  Protection as it applies to the use of I/O instructions and I/O port
     addresses.

8.1  I/O Addressing

The 80386 allows input/output to be performed in either of two ways:

  *  By means of a separate I/O address space (using specific I/O
     instructions)

  *  By means of memory-mapped I/O (using general-purpose operand
     manipulationinstructions).

<HR>
<A Name="8.1.1"><H2>8.1.1  I/O Address Space</H2>

8.1.1  I/O Address Space

The 80386 provides a separate I/O address space, distinct from physical
memory, that can be used to address the input/output ports that are used for
external 16 devices. The I/O address space consists of 2^(16) (64K)
individually addressable 8-bit ports; any two consecutive 8-bit ports can be
treated as a 16-bit port; and four consecutive 8-bit ports can be treated
as a 32-bit port. Thus, the I/O address space can accommodate up to 64K
8-bit ports, up to 32K 16-bit ports, or up to 16K 32-bit ports.

The program can specify the address of the port in two ways. Using an
immediate byte constant, the program can specify:

  *  256 8-bit ports numbered 0 through 255.
  *  128 16-bit ports numbered 0, 2, 4, . . . , 252, 254.
  *  64 32-bit ports numbered 0, 4, 8, . . . , 248, 252.

Using a value in DX, the program can specify:

  *  8-bit ports numbered 0 through 65535
  *  16-bit ports numbered 0, 2, 4, . . . , 65532, 65534
  *  32-bit ports numbered 0, 4, 8, . . . , 65528, 65532

The 80386 can transfer 32, 16, or 8 bits at a time to a device located in
the I/O space. Like doublewords in memory, 32-bit ports should be aligned at
addresses evenly divisible by four so that the 32 bits can be transferred in
a single bus access. Like words in memory, 16-bit ports should be aligned at
even-numbered addresses so that the 16 bits can be transferred in a single
bus access. An 8-bit port may be located at either an even or odd address.

The instructions IN and OUT move data between a register and a port in the
I/O address space. The instructions INS and OUTS move strings of data
between the memory address space and ports in the I/O address space.

<A Name="8.1.2"><H2>8.1.2  Memory-Mapped I/O</H2>

8.1.2  Memory-Mapped I/O

I/O devices also may be placed in the 80386 memory address space. As long
as the devices respond like memory components, they are indistinguishable to
the processor.

Memory-mapped I/O provides additional programming flexibility. Any
instruction that references memory may be used to access an I/O port located
in the memory space. For example, the MOV instruction can transfer data
between any register and a port; and the AND, OR, and TEST instructions may
be used to manipulate bits in the internal registers of a device (see Figure
8-1). Memory-mapped I/O performed via the full instruction set maintains
the full complement of addressing modes for selecting the desired I/O
device (e.g., direct address, indirect address, base register, index
register, scaling).

Memory-mapped I/O, like any other memory reference, is subject to access
protection and control when executing in protected mode. Refer to Chapter 6
for a discussion of memory protection.

8.2  I/O Instructions

The I/O instructions of the 80386 provide access to the processor's I/O
ports for the transfer of data to and from peripheral devices. These
instructions have as one operand the address of a port in the I/O address
space. There are two classes of I/O instruction:

  1.  Those that transfer a single item (byte, word, or doubleword) located
      in a register.

  2.  Those that transfer strings of items (strings of bytes, words, or
      doublewords) located in memory. These are known as "string I/O
      instructions" or "block I/O instructions".

<HR>
<A Name="8.2.1"><H2>8.2.1  Register I/O Instructions</H2>

8.2.1  Register I/O Instructions

The I/O instructions IN and OUT are provided to move data between I/O ports
and the EAX (32-bit I/O), the AX (16-bit I/O), or AL (8-bit I/O) general
registers. IN and OUT instructions address I/O ports either directly, with
the address of one of up to 256 port addresses coded in the instruction, or
indirectly via the DX register to one of up to 64K port addresses.

IN (Input from Port) transfers a byte, word, or doubleword from an input
port to AL, AX, or EAX. If a program specifies AL with the IN instruction,
the processor transfers 8 bits from the selected port to AL. If a program
specifies AX with the IN instruction, the processor transfers 16 bits from
the port to AX. If a program specifies EAX with the IN instruction, the
processor transfers 32 bits from the port to EAX.

OUT (Output to Port) transfers a byte, word, or doubleword to an output
port from AL, AX, or EAX. The program can specify the number of the port
using the same methods as the IN instruction.

<HR>
<A Name="8.2.2"><H2>8.2.2  Block I/O Instructions</H2>

8.2.2  Block I/O Instructions

The block (or string) I/O instructions INS and OUTS move blocks of data
between I/O ports and memory space. Block I/O instructions use the DX
register to specify the address of a port in the I/O address space. INS and
OUTS use DX to specify:

  *  8-bit ports numbered 0 through 65535
  *  16-bit ports numbered 0, 2, 4, . . . , 65532, 65534
  *  32-bit ports numbered 0, 4, 8, . . . , 65528, 65532

Block I/O instructions use either SI or DI to designate the source or
destination memory address. For each transfer, SI or DI are automatically
either incremented or decremented as specified by the direction bit in the
flags register.

INS and OUTS, when used with repeat prefixes, cause block input or output
operations. REP, the repeat prefix, modifies INS and OUTS to provide a means
of transferring blocks of data between an I/O port and memory. These block
I/O instructions are string primitives (refer also to Chapter 3 for more on
string primitives). They simplify programming and increase the speed of data
transfer by eliminating the need to use a separate LOOP instruction or an
intermediate register to hold the data.

The string I/O primitives can operate on byte strings, word strings, or
doubleword strings. After each transfer, the memory address in ESI or EDI is
updated by 1 for byte operands, by 2 for word operands, or by 4 for
doubleword operands. The value in the direction flag (DF) determines whether
the processor automatically increments ESI or EDI (DF=0) or whether it
automatically decrements these registers (DF=1).

INS (Input String from Port) transfers a byte or a word string element from
an input port to memory. The mnemonics INSB, INSW, and INSD are variants
that explicitly specify the size of the operand. If a program specifies
INSB, the processor transfers 8 bits from the selected port to the memory
location indicated by ES:EDI. If a program specifies INSW, the processor
transfers 16 bits from the port to the memory location indicated by ES:EDI.
If a program specifies INSD, the processor transfers 32 bits from the port
to the memory location indicated by ES:EDI. The destination segment register
choice (ES) cannot be changed for the INS instruction. Combined with the REP
prefix, INS moves a block of information from an input port to a series of
consecutive memory locations.

OUTS (Output String to Port) transfers a byte, word, or doubleword string
element to an output port from memory. The mnemonics OUTSB, OUTSW, and OUTSD
are variants that explicitly specify the size of the operand. If a program
specifies OUTSB, the processor transfers 8 bits from the memory location
indicated by ES:EDI to the the selected port. If a program specifies OUTSW,
the processor transfers 16 bits from the memory location indicated by ES:EDI
to the the selected port. If a program specifies OUTSD, the processor
transfers 32 bits from the memory location indicated by ES:EDI to the the
selected port. Combined with the REP prefix, OUTS moves a block of
information from a series of consecutive memory locations indicated by
DS:ESI to an output port.

<A Name="8.3"><H2>8.3  Protection and I/O</H2>

8.3  Protection and I/O

Two mechanisms provide protection for I/O functions:

  1.  The IOPL field in the EFLAGS register defines the right to use
      I/O-related instructions.

  2.  The I/O permission bit map of a 80386 TSS segment defines the right
      to use ports in the I/O address space.

These mechanisms operate only in protected mode, including virtual 8086
mode; they do not operate in real mode. In real mode, there is no protection
of the I/O space; any procedure can execute I/O instructions, and any I/O
port can be addressed by the I/O instructions.

<HR>
<A Name="8.3.1"><H2>8.3.1  I/O Privilege Level</H2>

8.3.1  I/O Privilege Level

Instructions that deal with I/O need to be restricted but also need to be
executed by procedures executing at privilege levels other than zero. For
this reason, the processor uses two bits of the flags register to store the
I/O privilege level (IOPL). The IOPL defines the privilege level
needed to execute I/O-related instructions.

The following instructions can be executed only if CPL <= IOPL:

IN      -- Input
INS     -- Input String
OUT     -- Output
OUTS    -- Output String
CLI     -- Clear Interrupt-Enable Flag
STI     -- Set Interrupt-Enable

These instructions are called "sensitive" instructions, because they are
sensitive to IOPL.

To use sensitive instructions, a procedure must execute at a privilege
level at least as privileged as that specified by the IOPL (CPL <= IOPL). Any
attempt by a less privileged procedure to use a sensitive instruction
results in a general protection exception.

Because each task has its own unique copy of the flags register, each task
can have a different IOPL. A task whose primary function is to perform I/O
(a device driver) can benefit from having an IOPL of three, thereby
permitting all procedures of the task to performI/O. Other tasks typically
have IOPL set to zero or one, reserving the right to perform I/O
instructions for the most privileged procedures.

A task can change IOPL only with the POPF instruction; however, such
changes are privileged. No procedure may alter IOPL (the I/O privilege level
in the flag register) unless the procedure is executing at privilege level
0. An attempt by a less privileged procedure to alter IOPL does not result
in an exception; IOPL simply remains unaltered.

The POPF instruction may be used in addition to CLI and STI to alter the
interrupt-enable flag (IF); however, changes to IF by POPF are
IOPL-sensitive. A procedure may alter IF with a POPF instruction only when
executing at a level that is at least as privileged as IOPL. An attempt by a
less privileged procedure to alter IF in this manner does not result in an
exception; IF simply remains unaltered.

<A Name="8.3.2"><H2>8.3.2  I/O Permission Bit Map</H2>



8.3.2  I/O Permission Bit Map

The I/O instructions that directly refer to addresses in the processor's
I/O space are IN, INS, OUT, OUTS. The 80386 has the ability to selectively
trap references to specific I/O addresses. The structure that enables
selective trapping is the I/O Permission Bit Map in the TSS segment (see
Figure 8-2). The I/O permission map is a bit vector. The size of the map
and its location in the TSS segment are variable. The processor locates the
I/O permission map by means of the I/O map base field in the fixed portion
of the TSS. The I/O map base field is 16 bits wide and contains the offset
of the beginning of the I/O permission map. The upper limit of the I/O
permission map is the same as the limit of the TSS segment.

In protected mode, when it encounters an I/O instruction (IN, INS, OUT, or
OUTS), the processor first checks whether CPL <= IOPL. If this condition is
true, the I/O operation may proceed. If not true, the processor checks the
I/O permission map. (In virtual 8086 mode, the processor consults the map
without regard for IOPL. Refer to Chapter 15.)

Each bit in the map corresponds to an I/O port byte address; for example,
the bit for port 41 is found at I/O map base + 5, bit offset 1. The
processor tests all the bits that correspond to the I/O addresses spanned by
an I/O operation; for example, a doubleword operation tests four bits
corresponding to four adjacent byte addresses. If any tested bit is set,
the processor signals a general protection exception. If all the tested bits
are zero, the I/O operation may proceed.

It is not necessary for the I/O permission map to represent all the I/O
addresses. I/O addresses not spanned by the map are treated as if they had
one bits in the map. For example, if TSS limit is equal to I/O map base +
31, the first 256 I/O ports are mapped; I/O operations on any port greater
than 255 cause an exception.

If I/O map base is greater than or equal to TSS limit, the TSS segment has
no I/O permission map, and all I/O instructions in the 80386 program cause
exceptions when CPL > IOPL.

Because the I/O permission map is in the TSS segment, different tasks can
have different maps. Thus, the operating system can allocate ports to a task
by changing the I/O permission map in the task's TSS.
