   Chapter 4  Systems Architecture

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many of the architectural features of the 80386 are used only by systems
programmers. This chapter presents an overview of these aspects of the
architecture.

The systems-level features of the 80386 architecture include:

  Memory Management
  Protection
  Multitasking
  Input/Output
  Exceptions and Interrupts
  Initialization
  Coprocessing and Multiprocessing
  Debugging

These features are implemented by registers and instructions, all of which
are introduced in the following sections. The purpose of this chapter is not
to explain each feature in detail, but rather to place the remaining
chapters of Part II in perspective. Each mention in this chapter of a
register or instruction is either accompanied by an explanation or a
reference to a following chapter where detailed information can be obtained.

<A Name="4.1"><H2>4.1  Systems Registers</H2>

4.1  Systems Registers

The registers designed for use by systems programmers fall into these
classes:

  EFLAGS
  Memory-Management Registers
  Control Registers
  Debug Registers
  Test Registers

<HR>
<A Name="4.1.1"><H2>4.1.1  Systems Flags</H2>

4.1.1  Systems Flags

The systems flags of the EFLAGS register control I/O, maskable interrupts,
debugging, task switching, and enabling of virtual 8086 execution in a
protected, multitasking environment. These flags are highlighted in Figure
4-1.

IF (Interrupt-Enable Flag, bit 9)

   Setting IF allows the CPU to recognize external (maskable) interrupt
   requests. Clearing IF disables these interrupts. IF has no effect on
   either exceptions or nonmaskable external interrupts. Refer to Chapter
   9 for more details about interrupts.

NT (Nested Task, bit 14)

   The processor uses the nested task flag to control chaining of
   interrupted and called tasks. NT influences the operation of the IRET
   instruction. Refer to Chapter 7 and Chapter 9 for more information on
   nested tasks.

RF (Resume Flag, bit 16)

   The RF flag temporarily disables debug exceptions so that an instruction
   can be restarted after a debug exception without immediately causing
   another debug exception. Refer to Chapter 12 for details.

TF (Trap Flag, bit 8)

   Setting TF puts the processor into single-step mode for debugging. In
   this mode, the CPU automatically generates an exception after each
   instruction, allowing a program to be inspected as it executes each
   instruction. Single-stepping is just one of several debugging features of
   the 80386. Refer to Chapter 12 for additional information.

VM (Virtual 8086 Mode, bit 17)

   When set, the VM flag indicates that the task is executing an 8086
   program. Refer to Chapter 14 for a detailed discussion of how the 80386
   executes 8086 tasks in a protected, multitasking environment.

<HR>
<A Name="4.1.2"><H2>4.1.2  Memory-Management Registers</H2>

4.1.2  Memory-Management Registers

Four registers of the 80386 locate the data structures that control
segmented memory management:

GDTR    Global Descriptor Table Register
LDTR    Local Descriptor Table Register

   These registers point to the segment descriptor tables GDT and LDT.
   Refer to Chapter 5 for an explanation of addressing via descriptor
   tables.

IDTR    Interrupt Descriptor Table Register

   This register points to a table of entry points for interrupt handlers
   (the IDT). Refer to Chapter 9 for details of the interrupt mechanism.

TR      Task Register

   This register points to the information needed by the processor to define
   the current task. Refer to Chapter 7 for a description of the
   multitasking features of the 80386.

<HR>
<A Name="4.1.3"><H2>4.1.3  Control Registers</H2>

4.1.3  Control Registers

Figure 4-2 shows the format of the 80386 control registers CR0, CR2, and
CR3. These registers are accessible to systems programmers only via variants
of the MOV instruction, which allow them to be loaded from or stored in
general registers; for example:

MOV EAX, CR0
MOV CR3, EBX

CR0 contains system control flags, which control or indicate conditions
that apply to the system as a whole, not to an individual task.

EM (Emulation, bit 2)

   EM indicates whether coprocessor functions are to be emulated. Refer to
   Chapter 11 for details.

ET (Extension Type, bit 4)

   ET indicates the type of coprocessor present in the system (80287 or
   80387). Refer to Chapter 11 and Chapter 10 for details.

MP (Math Present, bit 1)

   MP controls the function of the WAIT instruction, which is used to
   coordinate a coprocessor. Refer to Chapter 11 for details.

PE (Protection Enable, bit 0)

   Setting PE causes the processor to begin executing in protected mode.
   Resetting PE returns to real-address mode. Refer to Chapter 14 and
   Chapter 10 for more information on changing processor modes.

PG (Paging, bit 31)

   PG indicates whether the processor uses page tables to translate linear
   addresses into physical addresses. Refer to Chapter 5 for a description
   of page translation; refer to Chapter 10 for a discussion of how to set
   PG.

TS (Task Switched, bit 3)

   The processor sets TS with every task switch and tests TS when
   interpreting coprocessor instructions. Refer to Chapter 11 for details.

CR2 is used for handling page faults when PG is set. The processor stores
in CR2 the linear address that triggers the fault. Refer to Chapter 9 for a
description of page-fault handling.

CR3 is used when PG is set. CR3 enables the processor to locate the page
table directory for the current task. Refer to Chapter 5 for a description
of page tables and page translation.

<HR>
<A Name="4.1.4"><H2>4.1.4  Debug Register</H2>

4.1.4  Debug Register

The debug registers bring advanced debugging abilities to the 80386,
including data breakpoints and the ability to set instruction breakpoints
without modifying code segments. Refer to Chapter 12 for a complete
description of formats and usage.

<HR>
<A Name="4.1.5"><H2>4.1.5  Test Registers</H2>


4.1.5  Test Registers

The test registers are not a standard part of the 80386 architecture. They
are provided solely to enable confidence testing of the translation
lookaside buffer (TLB), the cache used for storing information from page
tables. Chapter 12 explains how to use these registers.

<HR>
<A Name="4.2"><H2>4.2  Systems Instructions</H2>

4.2  Systems Instructions

Systems instructions deal with such functions as:

  1.  Verification of pointer parameters (refer to Chapter 6):

    ARPL             -- Adjust RPL
    LAR              -- Load Access Rights
    LSL              -- Load Segment Limit

  2.  Addressing descriptor tables (refer to Chaper 5):

    LLDT             -- Load LDT Register
    SLDT             -- Store LDT Register
    LGDT             -- Load GDT Register
    SGDT             -- Store GDT Register

  3.  Multitasking (refer to Chapter 7):

    CLTS             -- Clear Task-Switched Flag
    ESC              -- Escape instructions
    WAIT             -- Wait until Coprocessor not Busy
    LOCK             -- Assert Bus-Lock Signal

  5.  Input and Output (refer to Chapter 8):

    IN               -- Input
    OUT              -- Output
    INS              -- Input String
    OUTS             -- Output String

  6.  Interrupt control (refer to Chapter 9):

    CLI              -- Clear Interrupt-Enable Flag
    STI              -- Set Interrupt-Enable Flag
    LIDT             -- Load IDT Register
    SIDT             -- Store IDT Register

  7.  Debugging (refer to Chapter 12):

    MOV              -- Move to and from debug registers

  8.  TLB testing (refer to Chapter 10):

    MOV              -- Move to and from test registers

  9.  System Control:

    SMSW             -- Set MSW

    HLT              -- Halt Processor
    MOV              -- Move to and from control registers

The instructions SMSW and LMSW are provided for compatibility with the
80286 processor.  80386 programs access the MSW in CR0 via variants of the
MOV instruction.  HLT stops the processor until receipt of an INTR or RESET
signal.

In addition to the chapters cited above, detailed information about each of
these instructions can be found in the instruction reference chapter,
Chapter 17.
