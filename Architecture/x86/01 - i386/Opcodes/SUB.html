Operation

IF SRC is a byte and DEST is a word or dword
THEN DEST = DEST - SignExtend(SRC);
ELSE DEST = DEST - SRC;
FI;

Description

SUB subtracts the second operand (SRC) from the first operand (DEST). The
first operand is assigned the result of the subtraction, and the flags are
set accordingly.

When an immediate byte value is subtracted from a word operand, the
immediate value is first sign-extended to the size of the destination
operand.

Flags Affected

OF, SF, ZF, AF, PF, and CF as described in Appendix C

Protected Mode Exceptions

#GP(0) if the result is in a nonwritable segment; #GP(0) for an illegal
memory operand effective address in the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS segments;
#SS(0) for an illegal address in the SS segment; #PF(fault-code) for a page
fault

Real Address Mode Exceptions

Interrupt 13 if any part of the operand would lie outside of the effective
address space from 0 to 0FFFFH

Virtual 8086 Mode Exceptions

Same exceptions as in Real Address Mode; #PF(fault-code) for a page fault
