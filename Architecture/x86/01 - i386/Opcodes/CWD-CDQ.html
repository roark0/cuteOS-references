CWD/CDQ -- Convert Word to Doubleword/Convert Doubleword to Quadword

Opcode    Instruction        Clocks   Description

99        CWD                2        DX:AX = sign-extend of AX
99        CDQ                2        EDX:EAX = sign-extend of EAX


Operation

IF OperandSize = 16 (* CWD instruction *)
THEN
   IF AX < 0 THEN DX = 0FFFFH; ELSE DX = 0; FI;
ELSE (* OperandSize = 32, CDQ instruction *)
   IF EAX < 0 THEN EDX = 0FFFFFFFFH; ELSE EDX = 0; FI;
FI;

Description

CWD converts the signed word in AX to a signed doubleword in DX:AX
by extending the most significant bit of AX into all the bits of DX. CDQ
converts the signed doubleword in EAX to a signed 64-bit integer in the
register pair EDX:EAX by extending the most significant bit of EAX
(the sign bit) into all the bits of EDX. Note that CWD is different from
CWDE. CWDE uses EAX as a destination, instead of DX:AX.
