Operation

FI;
IF byte type of instruction
THEN

   IF DF = 0 THEN IndDec = 1 ELSE IncDec = -1; FI;
ELSE
   IF OperandSize = 16
   THEN
      AX - [dest-index]; (* compare word in AL and dest *)
      IF DF = 0 THEN IncDec = 2 ELSE IncDec = -2; FI;
   ELSE (* OperandSize = 32 *)
      EAX - [dest-index];(* compare dword in EAX & dest *)

dest-index = dest-index + IncDec

Description

SCAS subtracts the memory byte or word at the destination register from
the AL, AX or EAX register. The result is discarded; only the flags are set.
The operand must be addressable from the ES segment; no segment override is
possible.

If the address-size attribute for this instruction is 16 bits, DI is used
as the destination register; otherwise, the address-size attribute is 32
bits and EDI is used.

The address of the memory data being compared is determined solely by the
contents of the destination register, not by the operand to SCAS. The
operand validates ES segment addressability and determines the data type.
Load the correct index value into DI or EDI before executing SCAS.

After the comparison is made, the destination register is automatically
updated. If the direction flag is 0 (CLD was executed), the destination
register is incremented; if the direction flag is 1 (STD was executed), it
is decremented. The increments or decrements are by 1 if bytes are compared,
by 2 if words are compared, or by 4 if doublewords are compared.

SCASB, SCASW, and SCASD are synonyms for the byte, word and
doubleword SCAS instructions that don't require operands. They are
simpler to code, but provide no type or segment checking.

SCAS can be preceded by the REPE or REPNE prefix for a block search
of CX or ECX bytes or words. Refer to the REP instruction for further
details.

Flags Affected

OF, SF, ZF, AF, PF, and CF as described in Appendix C

Protected Mode Exceptions

#GP(0) for an illegal memory operand effective address in the CS, DS,
ES, FS, or GS segments; #SS(0) for an illegal address in the SS segment;
#PF(fault-code) for a page fault

Real Address Mode Exceptions

Interrupt 13 if any part of the operand would lie outside of the effective
address space from 0 to 0FFFFH

Virtual 8086 Mode Exceptions

Same exceptions as in Real Address Mode; #PF(fault-code) for a page
fault
