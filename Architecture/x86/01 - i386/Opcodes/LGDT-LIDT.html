LGDT/LIDT -- Load Global/Interrupt Descriptor Table Register


Opcode       Instruction      Clocks        Description

0F  01 /2    LGDT m16&32      11            Load m into GDTR
0F  01 /3    LIDT m16&32      11            Load m into IDTR


Operation

IF instruction = LIDT
THEN
   IF OperandSize = 16
   THEN IDTR.Limit:Base = m16:24 (* 24 bits of base loaded *)
   ELSE IDTR.Limit:Base = m16:32
   FI;
ELSE (* instruction = LGDT *)
   IF OperandSize = 16
   THEN GDTR.Limit:Base = m16:24 (* 24 bits of base loaded *)
   ELSE GDTR.Limit:Base = m16:32;
   FI;
FI;

Description

The LGDT and LIDT instructions load a linear base address and limit
value from a six-byte data operand in memory into the GDTR or IDTR,
respectively. If a 16-bit operand is used with LGDT or LIDT, the
register is loaded with a 16-bit limit and a 24-bit base, and the
high-order eight bits of the six-byte data operand are not used. If a 32-bit
operand is used, a 16-bit limit and a 32-bit base is loaded; the high-order
eight bits of the six-byte operand are used as high-order base address bits.

The SGDT and SIDT instructions always store into all 48 bits of the
six-byte data operand. With the 80286, the upper eight bits are undefined
after SGDT or SIDT is executed. With the 80386, the upper eight bits
are written with the high-order eight address bits, for both a 16-bit
operand and a 32-bit operand. If LGDT or LIDT is used with a 16-bit
operand to load the register stored by SGDT or SIDT, the upper eight
bits are stored as zeros.

LGDT and LIDT appear in operating system software; they are not used
in application programs. They are the only instructions that directly load
a linear address (i.e., not a segment relative address) in 80386 Protected
Mode.

Flags Affected

None

Protected Mode Exceptions

#GP(0) if the current privilege level is not 0; #UD if the source operand
is a register; #GP(0) for an illegal memory operand effective address in
the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS segments; #SS(0) for an illegal address in
the SS segment; #PF(fault-code) for a page fault

Real Address Mode Exceptions

Interrupt 13 if any part of the operand would lie outside of the effective
address space from 0 to 0FFFFH; Interrupt 6 if the source operand is a
register

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note:
  These instructions are valid in Real Address Mode to allow
  power-up initialization for Protected Mode
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Virtual 8086 Mode Exceptions

Same exceptions as in Real Address Mode; #PF(fault-code) for a page
fault
