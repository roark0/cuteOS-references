POPA/POPAD -- Pop all General Registers


Opcode   Instruction   Clocks   Description

61       POPA          24       Pop DI, SI, BP, SP, BX, DX, CX, and AX
61       POPAD         24       Pop EDI, ESI, EBP, ESP, EDX, ECX, and EAX


Operation

IF OperandSize = 16 (* instruction = POPA *)
THEN
   DI = Pop();
   SI = Pop();
   BP = Pop();
   throwaway = Pop (); (* Skip SP *)
   BX = Pop();
   DX = Pop();
   CX = Pop();
   AX = Pop();
ELSE (* OperandSize = 32, instruction = POPAD *)
   EDI = Pop();
   ESI = Pop();
   EBP = Pop();
   throwaway = Pop (); (* Skip ESP *)
   EBX = Pop();
   EDX = Pop();
   ECX = Pop();
   EAX = Pop();
FI;

Description

POPA pops the eight 16-bit general registers. However, the SP value is
discarded instead of loaded into SP. POPA reverses a previous PUSHA,
restoring the general registers to their values before PUSHA was
executed. The first register popped is DI.

POPAD pops the eight 32-bit general registers. The ESP value is
discarded instead of loaded into ESP. POPAD reverses the previous
PUSHAD, restoring the general registers to their values before PUSHAD
was executed. The first register popped is EDI.

Flags Affected

None

Protected Mode Exceptions

#SS(0) if the starting or ending stack address is not within the stack
segment; #PF(fault-code) for a page fault

Real Address Mode Exceptions

Interrupt 13 if any part of the operand would lie outside of the effective
address space from 0 to 0FFFFH

Virtual 8086 Mode Exceptions

Same exceptions as in real-address mode; #PF(fault-code) for a page
fault
