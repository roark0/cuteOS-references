Operation

temp = DEST
DEST = SRC
SRC = temp

Description

XCHG exchanges two operands. The operands can be in either order. If a
memory operand is involved, BUS LOCK is asserted for the duration of the
exchange, regardless of the presence or absence of the LOCK prefix or of the
value of the IOPL.

Flags Affected

None

Protected Mode Exceptions

#GP(0) if either operand is in a nonwritable segment; #GP(0) for an
illegal memory operand effective address in the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS
segments; #SS(0) for an illegal address in the SS segment; #PF(fault-code)
for a page fault

Real Address Mode Exceptions

Interrupt 13 if any part of the operand would lie outside of the effective
address space from 0 to 0FFFFH

Virtual 8086 Mode Exceptions

Same exceptions as in Real Address Mode; #PF(fault-code) for a page
fault
