AAM -- ASCII Adjust AX after Multiply

Opcode    Instruction    Clocks    Description

D4 0A     AAM            17        ASCII adjust AX after multiply


Operation

AH = AL / 10;
AL = AL MOD 10;

Description

Execute AAM only after executing a MUL instruction between two unpacked
BCD digits that leaves the result in the AX register. Because the result is
less than 100, it is contained entirely in the AL register. AAM unpacks the
AL result by dividing AL by 10, leaving the quotient (most-significant
digit) in AH and the remainder (least-significant digit) in AL.
