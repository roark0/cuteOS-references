LMSW -- Load Machine Status Word


Opcode      Instruction      Clocks   Description

0F  01 /6   LMSW r/m16       10/13    Load r/m16 in machine status word


Operation

MSW = r/m16; (* 16 bits is stored in the machine status word *)

Description

LMSW loads the machine status word (part of CR0) from the source
operand. This instruction can be used to switch to Protected Mode; if so,
it must be followed by an intrasegment jump to flush the instruction
queue. LMSW will not switch back to Real Address Mode.

LMSW is used only in operating system software. It is not used in
application programs.

Flags Affected

None

Protected Mode Exceptions

#GP(0) if the current privilege level is not 0; #GP(0) for an illegal
memory operand effective address in the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS
segments; #SS(0) for an illegal address in the SS segment; #PF(fault-code)
for a page fault

Real Address Mode Exceptions

Interrupt 13 if any part of the operand would lie outside of the effective
address space from 0 to 0FFFFH

Virtual 8086 Mode Exceptions

Same exceptions as in Real Address Mode; #PF(fault-code) for a page
fault

Notes

The operand-size attribute has no effect on this instruction. This
instruction is provided for compatibility with the 80286; 80386 programs
should use MOV CR0, ... instead.
