CBW/CWDE -- Convert Byte to Word/Convert Word to Doubleword


Opcode    Instruction     Clocks          Description

98        CBW             3               AX = sign-extend of AL
98        CWDE            3               EAX = sign-extend of AX


Operation

IF OperandSize = 16 (* instruction = CBW *)
THEN AX = SignExtend(AL);
ELSE (* OperandSize = 32, instruction = CWDE *)
   EAX = SignExtend(AX);
FI;

Description

CBW converts the signed byte in AL to a signed word in AX by extending the
most significant bit of AL (the sign bit) into all of the bits of AH. CWDE
converts the signed word in AX to a doubleword in EAX by extending the most
significant bit of AX into the two most significant bytes of EAX. Note that
CWDE is different from CWD. CWD uses DX:AX rather than EAX as a destination.
