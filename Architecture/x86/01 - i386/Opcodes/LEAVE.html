LEAVE -- High Level Procedure Exit


Opcode  Instruction  Clocks  Description

C9      LEAVE        4       Set SP to BP, then pop BP
C9      LEAVE        4       Set ESP to EBP, then pop EBP


Operation

IF StackAddrSize = 16
THEN
   SP = BP;
ELSE (* StackAddrSize = 32 *)
   ESP = EBP;
FI;
IF OperandSize = 16
THEN
   BP = Pop();
ELSE (* OperandSize = 32 *)
   EBP = Pop();
FI;

Description

LEAVE reverses the actions of the ENTER instruction. By copying the
frame pointer to the stack pointer, LEAVE releases the stack space used
by a procedure for its local variables. The old frame pointer is popped
into BP or EBP, restoring the caller's frame. A subsequent RET
instruction removes any arguments pushed onto the stack of the exiting
procedure.

Flags Affected

None

Protected Mode Exceptions

#SS(0) if BP does not point to a location within the limits of the current
stack segment

Real Address Mode Exceptions

Interrupt 13 if any part of the operand would lie outside of the effective
address space from 0 to 0FFFFH

Virtual 8086 Mode Exceptions

Same exceptions as in Real Address Mode
