Description

INS transfers data from the input port numbered by the DX register to
the memory byte or word at ES:dest-index. The memory operand must
be addressable from ES; no segment override is possible. The destination
register is DI if the address-size attribute of the instruction is 16 bits,
or EDI if the address-size attribute is 32 bits.

INS does not allow the specification of the port number as an immediate
value. The port must be addressed through the DX register value. Load
the correct value into DX before executing the INS instruction.

The destination address is determined by the contents of the destination
index register. Load the correct index into the destination index register
before executing INS.

After the transfer is made, DI or EDI advances automatically. If the
direction flag is 0 (CLD was executed), DI or EDI increments; if the
direction flag is 1 (STD was executed), DI or EDI decrements. DI
increments or decrements by 1 if a byte is input, by 2 if a word is input,
or by 4 if a doubleword is input.

INSB, INSW and INSD are synonyms of the byte, word, and doubleword
INS instructions. INS can be preceded by the REP prefix for block input of
CX bytes or words. Refer to the REP instruction for details of this
operation.

Flags Affected

None

Protected Mode Exceptions

#GP(0) if CPL is numerically greater than IOPL and any of the
corresponding I/O permission bits in TSS equals 1; #GP(0) if the
destination is in a nonwritable segment; #GP(0) for an illegal memory
operand effective address in the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS segments; #SS(0) for
an illegal address in the SS segment; #PF(fault-code) for a page fault

Real Address Mode Exceptions

Interrupt 13 if any part of the operand would lie outside of the effective
address space from 0 to 0FFFFH

Virtual 8086 Mode Exceptions

#GP(0) fault if any of the corresponding I/O permission bits in TSS
equals 1; #PF(fault-code) for a page fault
