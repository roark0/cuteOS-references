Description

STOS transfers the contents of all AL, AX, or EAX register to the memory
byte or word given by the destination register relative to the ES segment.
The destination register is DI for an address-size attribute of 16 bits or
EDI for an address-size attribute of 32 bits.

The destination operand must be addressable from the ES register. A segment
override is not possible.

The address of the destination is determined by the contents of the
destination register, not by the explicit operand of STOS. This operand is
used only to validate ES segment addressability and to determine the data
type. Load the correct index value into the destination register before
executing STOS.

After the transfer is made, DI is automatically updated. If the direction
flag is 0 (CLD was executed), DI is incremented; if the direction flag is
1 (STD was executed), DI is decremented. DI is incremented or decremented by
1 if a byte is stored, by 2 if a word is stored, or by 4 if a doubleword is
stored.

STOSB, STOSW, and STOSD are synonyms for the byte, word, and doubleword STOS
instructions, that do not require an operand. They are simpler to use, but
provide no type or segment checking.

STOS can be preceded by the REP prefix for a block fill of CX or ECX bytes,
words, or doublewords. Refer to the REP instruction for further details.

Flags Affected

None

Protected Mode Exceptions

#GP(0) if the result is in a nonwritable segment; #GP(0) for an illegal
memory operand effective address in the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS segments;
#SS(0) for an illegal address in the SS segment; #PF(fault-code) for a page
fault

Real Address Mode Exceptions

Interrupt 13 if any part of the operand would lie outside of the effective
address space from 0 to 0FFFFH

Virtual 8086 Mode Exceptions

Same exceptions as in Real Address Mode; #PF(fault-code) for a page fault
