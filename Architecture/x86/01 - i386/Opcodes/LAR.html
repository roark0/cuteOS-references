LAR -- Load Access Rights Byte


Opcode        Instruction      Clocks      Description

0F  02 /r     LAR r16,r/m16    pm=15/16    r16 = r/m16 masked by FF00
0F  02 /r     LAR r32,r/m32    pm=15/16    r32 = r/m32 masked by 00FxFF00


Description

The LAR instruction stores a marked form of the second doubleword of
the descriptor for the source selector if the selector is visible at the
CPL (modified by the selector's RPL) and is a valid descriptor type. The
destination register is loaded with the high-order doubleword of the
descriptor masked by 00FxFF00, and ZF is set to 1. The x indicates that the
four bits corresponding to the upper four bits of the limit are undefined in
the value loaded by LAR. If the selector is invisible or of the wrong type,
ZF is cleared.

If the 32-bit operand size is specified, the entire 32-bit value is loaded
into the 32-bit destination register. If the 16-bit operand size is
specified, the lower 16-bits of this value are stored in the 16-bit
destination register.

All code and data segment descriptors are valid for LAR.

The valid special segment and gate descriptor types for LAR are given
in the following table:

Flags Affected

ZF as described above

Protected Mode Exceptions

#GP(0) for an illegal memory operand effective address in the CS, DS,
ES, FS, or GS segments; #SS(0) for an illegal address in the SS segment;
#PF(fault-code) for a page fault

Real Address Mode Exceptions

Interrupt 6; LAR is unrecognized in Real Address Mode

Virtual 8086 Mode Exceptions

Same exceptions as in Real Address Mode
