---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES:
  moffs8, moffs16, and moffs32 all consist of a simple offset relative
  to the segment base. The 8, 16, and 32 refer to the size of the data. The
  address-size attribute of the instruction determines the size of the
  offset, either 16 or 32 bits.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Operation

DEST = SRC;

Description

MOV copies the second operand to the first operand.

If the destination operand is a segment register (DS, ES, SS, etc.), then
data from a descriptor is also loaded into the register. The data for the
register is obtained from the descriptor table entry for the selector
given. A null selector (values 0000-0003) can be loaded into DS and ES
registers without causing an exception; however, use of DS or ES causes a
#GP(0), and no memory reference occurs.

A MOV into SS inhibits all interrupts until after the execution of the
next instruction (which is presumably a MOV into eSP).

Loading a segment register under 80386 Protected Mode results in special
checks and actions, as described in the following listing:

IF SS is loaded;
THEN
   IF selector is null THEN #GP(0);
FI;
   Selector index must be within its descriptor table limits else
      #GP(selector);
   Selector's RPL must equal CPL else #GP(selector);
AR byte must indicate a writable data segment else #GP(selector);
   DPL in the AR byte must equal CPL else #GP(selector);
   Segment must be marked present else #SS(selector);
   Load SS with selector;
   Load SS with descriptor.
FI;
IF DS, ES, FS or GS is loaded with non-null selector;
THEN
   Selector index must be within its descriptor table limits
      else #GP(selector);
   AR byte must indicate data or readable code segment else
      #GP(selector);
   IF data or nonconforming code segment
   THEN both the RPL and the CPL must be less than or equal to DPL in
      AR byte;
   ELSE #GP(selector);
   FI;
   Segment must be marked present else #NP(selector);
   Load segment register with selector;
   Load segment register with descriptor;
FI;
IF DS, ES, FS or GS is loaded with a null selector;
THEN
   Load segment register with selector;
   Clear descriptor valid bit;
FI;

Flags Affected

None

Protected Mode Exceptions

#GP, #SS, and #NP if a segment register is being loaded; otherwise,
#GP(0) if the destination is in a nonwritable segment; #GP(0) for an
illegal memory operand effective address in the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS
segments; #SS(0) for an illegal address in the SS segment; #PF(fault-code)
for a page fault

Real Address Mode Exceptions

Interrupt 13 if any part of the operand would lie outside of the effective
address space from 0 to 0FFFFH

Virtual 8086 Mode Exceptions

Same exceptions as in Real Address Mode; #PF(fault-code) for a page
fault

Operation

DEST = SRC;

Description

The above forms of MOV store or load the following special registers in
or from a general purpose register:

  *  Control registers CR0, CR2, and CR3
  *  Debug Registers DR0, DR1, DR2, DR3, DR6, and DR7
  *  Test Registers TR6 and TR7

32-bit operands are always used with these instructions, regardless of the
operand-size attribute.

Flags Affected

OF, SF, ZF, AF, PF, and CF are undefined

Protected Mode Exceptions

#GP(0) if the current privilege level is not 0

Real Address Mode Exceptions

None

Virtual 8086 Mode Exceptions

#GP(0) if instruction execution is attempted

Notes

The instructions must be executed at privilege level 0 or in real-address
mode; otherwise, a protection exception will be raised.

The reg field within the ModRM byte specifies which of the special
registers in each category is involved. The two bits in the  field are
always 11. The r/m field specifies the general register involved.
