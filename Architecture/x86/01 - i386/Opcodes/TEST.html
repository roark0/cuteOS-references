Operation

DEST : = LeftSRC AND RightSRC;
CF = 0;
OF = 0;

Description

TEST computes the bit-wise logical AND of its two operands. Each bit
of the result is 1 if both of the corresponding bits of the operands are 1;
otherwise, each bit is 0. The result of the operation is discarded and only
the flags are modified.

Flags Affected

OF = 0, CF = 0; SF, ZF, and PF as described in Appendix C

Protected Mode Exceptions

#GP(0) for an illegal memory operand effective address in the CS, DS,
ES, FS, or GS segments; #SS(0) for an illegal address in the SS segment;
#PF(fault-code) for a page fault

Real Address Mode Exceptions

Interrupt 13 if any part of the operand would lie outside of the effective
address space from 0 to 0FFFFH

Virtual 8086 Mode Exceptions

Same exceptions as in Real Address Mode; #PF(fault-code) for a page
fault
