CLTS -- Clear Task-Switched Flag in CR0


Opcode    Instruction    Clocks   Description

OF  06    CLTS           5        Clear task-switched flag


Operation

TS Flag in CR0 = 0;

Description

CLTS clears the task-switched (TS) flag in register CR0. This flag is set by
the 80386 every time a task switch occurs. The TS flag is used to manage
processor extensions as follows:

  *  Every execution of an ESC instruction is trapped if the TS flag is set.

  *  Execution of a WAIT instruction is trapped if the MP flag and the TS
     flag are both set.

Thus, if a task switch was made after an ESC instruction was begun, the
processor extension's context may need to be saved before a new ESC
instruction can be issued. The fault handler saves the context and resets
the TS flag.

CLTS appears in operating system software, not in application programs. It
is a privileged instruction that can only be executed at privilege level 0.

Flags Affected

TS = 0 (TS is in CR0, not the flag register)

Protected Mode Exceptions

#GP(0) if CLTS is executed with a current privilege level other than 0

Real Address Mode Exceptions

None (valid in Real Address Mode to allow initialization for Protected
Mode)

Virtual 8086 Mode Exceptions

Same exceptions as in Real Address Mode
