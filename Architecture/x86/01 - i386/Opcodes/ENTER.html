Description

ENTER creates the stack frame required by most block-structured
high-level languages. The first operand specifies the number of bytes of
dynamic storage allocated on the stack for the routine being entered.
The second operand gives the lexical nesting level (0 to 31) of the routine
within the high-level language source code. It determines the number of
stack frame pointers copied into the new stack frame from the preceding
frame. BP (or EBP, if the operand-size attribute is 32 bits) is the current
stack frame pointer.

If the operand-size attribute is 16 bits, the processor uses BP as the
frame pointer and SP as the stack pointer. If the operand-size attribute is
32 bits, the processor uses EBP for the frame pointer and ESP for the stack
pointer.

If the second operand is 0, ENTER pushes the frame pointer (BP or
EBP) onto the stack; ENTER then subtracts the first operand from the
stack pointer and sets the frame pointer to the current stack-pointer
value.

For example, a procedure with 12 bytes of local variables would have an
ENTER 12,0 instruction at its entry point and a LEAVE instruction
before every RET. The 12 local bytes would be addressed as negative
offsets from the frame pointer.
