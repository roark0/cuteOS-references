instruction, either an immediate byte or the byte in register CL *)

THEN no operation
ELSE

   ELSE (* Perform the shift *)

Description

SHRD shifts the first operand provided by the r/m field to the right as many
bits as specified by the count operand. The second operand (r16 or r32)
provides the bits to shift in from the left (starting with bit 31). The
result is stored back into the r/m operand. The register remains unaltered.

The count operand is provided by either an immediate byte or the contents
of the CL register. These operands are taken MODULO 32 to provide a number
between 0 and 31 by which to shift. Because the bits to shift are provided
by the specified register, the operation is useful for multi-precision
shifts (64 bits or more). The SF, ZF and PF flags are set according to the
value of the result. CS is set to the value of the last bit shifted out. OF
and AF are left undefined.

Flags Affected

OF, SF, ZF, PF, and CF as described above; AF and OF are undefined

Protected Mode Exceptions

#GP(0) if the result is in a nonwritable segment; #GP(0) for an illegal
memory operand effective address in the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS
segments; #SS(0) for an illegal address in the SS segment; #PF(fault-code)
for a page fault

Real Address Mode Exceptions

Interrupt 13 if any part of the operand would lie outside of the effective
address space from 0 to 0FFFFH

Virtual 8086 Mode Exceptions

Same exceptions as in Real Address Mode; #PF(fault-code) for a page
fault
