PUSHF decrements the stack pointer by 2 and copies the FLAGS
register to the new top of stack; PUSHFD decrements the stack pointer by
4, and the 80386 EFLAGS register is copied to the new top of stack
which is pointed to by SS:eSP. Refer to Chapter 2 and Chapter 4 for
information on the EFLAGS register.

Virtual 8086 Mode Exceptions

#GP(0) fault if IOPL is less than 3, to permit emulation
