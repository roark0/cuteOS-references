Operation

LeftSRC - SignExtend(RightSRC);
(* CMP does not store a result; its purpose is to set the flags *)

Description

CMP subtracts the second operand from the first but, unlike the SUB
instruction, does not store the result; only the flags are changed. CMP is
typically used in conjunction with conditional jumps and the SETcc
instruction. (Refer to Appendix D for the list of signed and unsigned flag
tests provided.) If an operand greater than one byte is compared to an
immediate byte, the byte value is first sign-extended.

Flags Affected

OF, SF, ZF, AF, PF, and CF as described in Appendix C

Protected Mode Exceptions

#GP(0) for an illegal memory operand effective address in the CS, DS, ES,
FS, or GS segments; #SS(0) for an illegal address in the SS segment;
#PF(fault-code) for a page fault

Real Address Mode Exceptions

Interrupt 13 if any part of the operand would lie outside of the effective
address space from 0 to 0FFFFH

Virtual 8086 Mode Exceptions

Same exceptions as in Real Address Mode; #PF(fault-code) for a page fault
