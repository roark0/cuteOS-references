  Chapter 7  Multitasking

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To provide efficient, protected multitasking, the 80386 employs several
special data structures. It does not, however, use special instructions to
control multitasking; instead, it interprets ordinary control-transfer
instructions differently when they refer to the special data structures. The
registers and data structures that support multitasking are:

  *  Task state segment
  *  Task state segment descriptor
  *  Task register
  *  Task gate descriptor

With these structures the 80386 can rapidly switch execution from one task
to another, saving the context of the original task so that the task can be
restarted later. In addition to the simple task switch, the 80386 offers two
other task-management features:

  1.  Interrupts and exceptions can cause task switches (if needed in the
      system design). The processor not only switches automatically to the
      task that handles the interrupt or exception, but it automatically
      switches back to the interrupted task when the interrupt or exception
      has been serviced. Interrupt tasks may interrupt lower-priority
      interrupt tasks to any depth.

  2.  With each switch to another task, the 80386 can also switch to
      another LDT and to another page directory. Thus each task can have a
      different logical-to-linear mapping and a different linear-to-physical
      mapping. This is yet another protection feature, because tasks can be
      isolated and prevented from interfering with one another.

<A Name="7.1"><H2>7.1  Task State Segment</H2>

7.1  Task State Segment

All the information the processor needs in order to manage a task is stored
in a special type of segment, a task state segment (TSS). Figure 7-1 shows
the format of a TSS for executing 80386 tasks. (Another format is used for
executing 80286 tasks; refer to Chapter 13.)

The fields of a TSS belong to two classes:

  1.  A dynamic set that the processor updates with each switch from the
      task. This set includes the fields that store:

      *  The general registers (EAX, ECX, EDX, EBX, ESP, EBP, ESI, EDI).

      *  The segment registers (ES, CS, SS, DS, FS, GS).

      *  The flags register (EFLAGS).

      *  The instruction pointer (EIP).

      *  The selector of the TSS of the previously executing task (updated
         only when a return is expected).

  2.  A static set that the processor reads but does not change. This set
      includes the fields that store:

      *  The selector of the task's LDT.

      *  The register (PDBR) that contains the base address of the task's
         page directory (read only when paging is enabled).

      *  Pointers to the stacks for privilege levels 0-2.

      *  The T-bit (debug trap bit) which causes the processor to raise a
         debug exception when a task switch occurs. (Refer to Chapter 12
         for more information on debugging.)

      *  The I/O map base (refer to Chapter 8 for more information on the
         use of the I/O map).

Task state segments may reside anywhere in the linear space. The only case
that requires caution is when the TSS spans a page boundary and the
higher-addressed page is not present. In this case, the processor raises an
exception if it encounters the not-present page while reading the TSS during
a task switch. Such an exception can be avoided by either of two strategies:

  1.  By allocating the TSS so that it does not cross a page boundary.

  2.  By ensuring that both pages are either both present or both 
      not-present at the time of a task switch. If both pages are 
      not-present, then the page-fault handler must make both pages present 
      before restarting the instruction that caused the task switch.

<A Name="7.2"><H2>7.2  TSS Descriptor</H2>

7.2  TSS Descriptor

The task state segment, like all other segments, is defined by a
descriptor. Figure 7-2 shows the format of a TSS descriptor.

The B-bit in the type field indicates whether the task is busy. A type code
of 9 indicates a non-busy task; a type code of 11 indicates a busy task.
Tasks are not reentrant. The B-bit allows the processor to detect an attempt
to switch to a task that is already busy.

The BASE, LIMIT, and DPL fields and the G-bit and P-bit have functions
similar to their counterparts in data-segment descriptors. The LIMIT field,
however, must have a value equal to or greater than 103. An attempt to
switch to a task whose TSS descriptor has a limit less that 103 causes an
exception. A larger limit is permissible, and a larger limit is required if
an I/O permission map is present. A larger limit may also be convenient for
systems software if additional data is stored in the same segment as the
TSS.

A procedure that has access to a TSS descriptor can cause a task switch. In
most systems the DPL fields of TSS descriptors should be set to zero, so
that only trusted software has the right to perform task switching.

Having access to a TSS-descriptor does not give a procedure the right to
read or modify a TSS. Reading and modification can be accomplished only with
another descriptor that redefines the TSS as a data segment. An attempt to
load a TSS descriptor into any of the segment registers (CS, SS, DS, ES, FS,
GS) causes an exception.

TSS descriptors may reside only in the GDT. An attempt to identify a TSS
with a selector that has TI=1 (indicating the current LDT) results in an
exception.

<HR>
<A Name="7.3"><H2>7.3  Task Register</H2>

7.3  Task Register

The task register (TR) identifies the currently executing task by pointing
to the TSS. Figure 7-3 shows the path by which the processor accesses the
current TSS.

The task register has both a "visible" portion (i.e., can be read and
changed by instructions) and an "invisible" portion (maintained by the
processor to correspond to the visible portion; cannot be read by any
instruction). The selector in the visible portion selects a TSS descriptor
in the GDT. The processor uses the invisible portion to cache the base and
limit values from the TSS descriptor. Holding the base and limit in a
register makes execution of the task more efficient, because the processor
does not need to repeatedly fetch these values from memory when it
references the TSS of the current task.

The instructions LTR and STR are used to modify and read the visible
portion of the task register. Both instructions take one operand, a 16-bit
selector located in memory or in a general register.

LTR (Load task register) loads the visible portion of the task register
with the selector operand, which must select a TSS descriptor in the GDT.
LTR also loads the invisible portion with information from the TSS
descriptor selected by the operand. LTR is a privileged instruction; it may
be executed only when CPL is zero. LTR is generally used during system
initialization to give an initial value to the task register; thereafter,
the contents of TR are changed by task switch operations.

STR (Store task register) stores the visible portion of the task register
in a general register or memory word. STR is not privileged.

<A Name="7.4"><H2>7.4  Task Gate Descriptor</H2>

7.4  Task Gate Descriptor

A task gate descriptor provides an indirect, protected reference to a TSS.
Figure 7-4 illustrates the format of a task gate.

The SELECTOR field of a task gate must refer to a TSS descriptor. The value
of the RPL in this selector is not used by the processor.

The DPL field of a task gate controls the right to use the descriptor to
cause a task switch. A procedure may not select a task gate descriptor
unless the maximum of the selector's RPL and the CPL of the procedure is
numerically less than or equal to the DPL of the descriptor. This constraint
prevents untrusted procedures from causing a task switch. (Note that when a
task gate is used, the DPL of the target TSS descriptor is not used for
privilege checking.)

A procedure that has access to a task gate has the power to cause a task
switch, just as a procedure that has access to a TSS descriptor. The 80386
has task gates in addition to TSS descriptors to satisfy three needs:

  1.  The need for a task to have a single busy bit. Because the busy-bit
      is stored in the TSS descriptor, each task should have only one such
      descriptor. There may, however, be several task gates that select the
      single TSS descriptor.

  2.  The need to provide selective access to tasks. Task gates fulfill
      this need, because they can reside in LDTs and can have a DPL that is
      different from the TSS descriptor's DPL. A procedure that does not
      have sufficient privilege to use the TSS descriptor in the GDT (which
      usually has a DPL of 0) can still switch to another task if it has
      access to a task gate for that task in its LDT. With task gates,
      systems software can limit the right to cause task switches to
      specific tasks.

  3.  The need for an interrupt or exception to cause a task switch. Task
      gates may also reside in the IDT, making it possible for interrupts
      and exceptions to cause task switching. When interrupt or exception
      vectors to an IDT entry that contains a task gate, the 80386 switches
      to the indicated task. Thus, all tasks in the system can benefit from
      the protection afforded by isolation from interrupt tasks.

Figure 7-5 illustrates how both a task gate in an LDT and a task gate in
the IDT can identify the same task.

<HR>
<A Name="7.5"><H2>7.5  Task Switching</H2>

7.5  Task Switching

The 80386 switches execution to another task in any of four cases:

  1.  The current task executes a JMP or CALL that refers to a TSS
      descriptor.

  2.  The current task executes a JMP or CALL that refers to a task gate.

  3.  An interrupt or exception vectors to a task gate in the IDT.

  4.  The current task executes an IRET when the NT flag is set.

JMP, CALL, IRET, interrupts, and exceptions are all ordinary mechanisms of
the 80386 that can be used in circumstances that do not require a task
switch. Either the type of descriptor referenced or the NT (nested task) bit
in the flag word distinguishes between the standard mechanism and the
variant that causes a task switch.

To cause a task switch, a JMP or CALL instruction can refer either to a TSS
descriptor or to a task gate. The effect is the same in either case: the
80386 switches to the indicated task.

An exception or interrupt causes a task switch when it vectors to a task
gate in the IDT. If it vectors to an interrupt or trap gate in the IDT, a
task switch does not occur. Refer to Chapter 9 for more information on the
interrupt mechanism.

Whether invoked as a task or as a procedure of the interrupted task, an
interrupt handler always returns control to the interrupted procedure in the
interrupted task. If the NT flag is set, however, the handler is an
interrupt task, and the IRET switches back to the interrupted task.

A task switching operation involves these steps:

  1.  Checking that the current task is allowed to switch to the designated
      task. Data-access privilege rules apply in the case of JMP or CALL
      instructions. The DPL of the TSS descriptor or task gate must be less
      than or equal to the maximum of CPL and the RPL of the gate selector.
      Exceptions, interrupts, and IRETs are permitted to switch tasks
      regardless of the DPL of the target task gate or TSS descriptor.

  2.  Checking that the TSS descriptor of the new task is marked present
      and has a valid limit. Any errors up to this point occur in the
      context of the outgoing task. Errors are restartable and can be
      handled in a way that is transparent to applications procedures.

  3.  Saving the state of the current task. The processor finds the base
      address of the current TSS cached in the task register. It copies the
      registers into the current TSS (EAX, ECX, EDX, EBX, ESP, EBP, ESI,
      EDI, ES, CS, SS, DS, FS, GS, and the flag register). The EIP field of
      the TSS points to the instruction after the one that caused the task
      switch.

  4.  Loading the task register with the selector of the incoming task's
      TSS descriptor, marking the incoming task's TSS descriptor as busy,
      and setting the TS (task switched) bit of the MSW. The selector is
      either the operand of a control transfer instruction or is taken from
      a task gate.

  5.  Loading the incoming task's state from its TSS and resuming
      execution. The registers loaded are the LDT register; the flag
      register; the general registers EIP, EAX, ECX, EDX, EBX, ESP, EBP,
      ESI, EDI; the segment registers ES, CS, SS, DS, FS, and GS; and PDBR.
      Any errors detected in this step occur in the context of the incoming
      task. To an exception handler, it appears that the first instruction
      of the new task has not yet executed.

Note that the state of the outgoing task is always saved when a task switch
occurs. If execution of that task is resumed, it starts after the
instruction that caused the task switch. The registers are restored to the
values they held when the task stopped executing.

Every task switch sets the TS (task switched) bit in the MSW (machine
status word). The TS flag is useful to systems software when a coprocessor
(such as a numerics coprocessor) is present. The TS bit signals that the
context of the coprocessor may not correspond to the current 80386 task.
Chapter 11 discusses the TS bit and coprocessors in more detail.

Exception handlers that field task-switch exceptions in the incoming task
(exceptions due to tests 4 thru 16 of Table 7-1) should be cautious about
taking any action that might load the selector that caused the exception.
Such an action will probably cause another exception, unless the exception
handler first examines the selector and fixes any potential problem.

The privilege level at which execution resumes in the incoming task is
neither restricted nor affected by the privilege level at which the outgoing
task was executing. Because the tasks are isolated by their separate address
spaces and TSSs and because privilege rules can be used to prevent improper
access to a TSS, no privilege rules are needed to constrain the relation
between the CPLs of the tasks. The new task begins executing at the
privilege level indicated by the RPL of the CS selector value that is loaded
from the TSS.

<A Name="7.6"><H2>7.6  Task Linking</H2>

7.6  Task Linking

The back-link field of the TSS and the NT (nested task) bit of the flag
word together allow the 80386 to automatically return to a task that CALLed
another task or was interrupted by another task. When a CALL instruction, an
interrupt instruction, an external interrupt, or an exception causes a
switch to a new task, the 80386 automatically fills the back-link of the new
TSS with the selector of the outgoing task's TSS and, at the same time,
sets the NT bit in the new task's flag register. The NT flag indicates
whether the back-link field is valid. The new task releases control by
executing an IRET instruction. When interpreting an IRET, the 80386 examines
the NT flag. If NT is set, the 80386 switches back to the task selected by
the back-link field. Table 7-2 summarizes the uses of these fields.

<HR>
<A Name="7.6.1"><H2>7.6.1  Busy Bit Prevents Loops</H2>

7.6.1  Busy Bit Prevents Loops

The B-bit (busy bit) of the TSS descriptor ensures the integrity of the
back-link. A chain of back-links may grow to any length as interrupt tasks
interrupt other interrupt tasks or as called tasks call other tasks. The
busy bit ensures that the CPU can detect any attempt to create a loop. A
loop would indicate an attempt to reenter a task that is already busy;
however, the TSS is not a reentrable resource.

The processor uses the busy bit as follows:

  1.  When switching to a task, the processor automatically sets the busy
      bit of the new task.

  2.  When switching from a task, the processor automatically clears the
      busy bit of the old task if that task is not to be placed on the
      back-link chain (i.e., the instruction causing the task switch is JMP
      or IRET). If the task is placed on the back-link chain, its busy bit
      remains set.

  3.  When switching to a task, the processor signals an exception if the
      busy bit of the new task is already set.

By these actions, the processor prevents a task from switching to itself or
to any task that is on a back-link chain, thereby preventing invalid reentry
into a task.

The busy bit is effective even in multiprocessor configurations, because
the processor automatically asserts a bus lock when it sets or clears the
busy bit. This action ensures that two processors do not invoke the same
task at the same time. (Refer to Chapter 11 for more on multiprocessing.)

<A Name="7.6.2"><H2>7.6.2  Modifying Task Linkages</H2>

7.6.2  Modifying Task Linkages

Any modification of the linkage order of tasks should be accomplished only
by software that can be trusted to correctly update the back-link and the
busy-bit. Such changes may be needed to resume an interrupted task before
the task that interrupted it. Trusted software that removes a task from the
back-link chain must follow one of the following policies:

  1.  First change the back-link field in the TSS of the interrupting task,
      then clear the busy-bit in the TSS descriptor of the task removed from
      the list.

  2.  Ensure that no interrupts occur between updating the back-link chain
      and the busy bit.

<A Name="7.7"><H2>7.7  Task Address Space</H2>

7.7  Task Address Space

The LDT selector and PDBR fields of the TSS give software systems designers
flexibility in utilization of segment and page mapping features of the
80386. By appropriate choice of the segment and page mappings for each task,
tasks may share address spaces, may have address spaces that are largely
distinct from one another, or may have any degree of sharing between these
two extremes.

The ability for tasks to have distinct address spaces is an important
aspect of 80386 protection. A module in one task cannot interfere with a
module in another task if the modules do not have access to the same address
spaces. The flexible memory management features of the 80386 allow systems
designers to assign areas of shared address space to those modules of
different tasks that are designed to cooperate with each other.

<HR>
<A Name="7.7.1"><H2>7.7.1  Task Linear-to-Physical Space Mapping</H2>

7.7.1  Task Linear-to-Physical Space Mapping

The choices for arranging the linear-to-physical mappings of tasks fall
into two general classes:

  1.  One linear-to-physical mapping shared among all tasks.

      When paging is not enabled, this is the only possibility. Without page
      tables, all linear addresses map to the same physical addresses.

      When paging is enabled, this style of linear-to-physical mapping 
      results from using one page directory for all tasks. The linear space
      utilized may exceed the physical space available if the operating 
      system also implements page-level virtual memory.

  2.  Several partially overlapping linear-to-physical mappings.

      This style is implemented by using a different page directory for each
      task. Because the PDBR (page directory base register) is loaded from 
      the TSS with each task switch, each task may have a different page 
      directory.

In theory, the linear address spaces of different tasks may map to
completely distinct physical addresses. If the entries of different page
directories point to different page tables and the page tables point to
different pages of physical memory, then the tasks do not share any physical
addresses.

In practice, some portion of the linear address spaces of all tasks must
map to the same physical addresses. The task state segments must lie in a
common space so that the mapping of TSS addresses does not change while the
processor is reading and updating the TSSs during a task switch. The linear
space mapped by the GDT should also be mapped to a common physical space;
otherwise, the purpose of the GDT is defeated. Figure 7-6 shows how the
linear spaces of two tasks can overlap in the physical space by sharing
page tables.

<HR>
<A Name="7.7.2"><H2>7.7.2  Task Logical Address Space</H2>


7.7.2  Task Logical Address Space

By itself, a common linear-to-physical space mapping does not enable
sharing of data among tasks. To share data, tasks must also have a common
logical-to-linear space mapping; i.e., they must also have access to
descriptors that point into a shared linear address space. There are three
ways to create common logical-to-physical address-space mappings:

  1.  Via the GDT. All tasks have access to the descriptors in the GDT. If
      those descriptors point into a linear-address space that is mapped to
      a common physical-address space for all tasks, then the tasks can
      share data and instructions.

  2.  By sharing LDTs. Two or more tasks can use the same LDT if the LDT
      selectors in their TSSs select the same LDT segment. Those
      LDT-resident descriptors that point into a linear space that is mapped
      to a common physical space permit the tasks to share physical memory.
      This method of sharing is more selective than sharing by the GDT; the
      sharing can be limited to specific tasks. Other tasks in the system
      may have different LDTs that do not give them access to the shared
      areas.

  3.  By descriptor aliases in LDTs. It is possible for certain descriptors
      of different LDTs to point to the same linear address space. If that
      linear address space is mapped to the same physical space by the page
      mapping of the tasks involved, these descriptors permit the tasks to
      share the common space. Such descriptors are commonly called
      "aliases". This method of sharing is even more selective than the
      prior two; other descriptors in the LDTs may point to distinct linear
      addresses or to linear addresses that are not shared.
