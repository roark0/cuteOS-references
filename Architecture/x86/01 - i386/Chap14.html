Chapter 14  80386 Real-Address Mode

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The real-address mode of the 80386 executes object code designed for
execution on 8086, 8088, 80186, or 80188 processors, or for execution in the
real-address mode of an 80286:

In effect, the architecture of the 80386 in this mode is almost identical
to that of the 8086, 8088, 80186, and 80188. To a programmer, an 80386 in
real-address mode appears as a high-speed 8086 with extensions to the
instruction set and registers. The principal features of this architecture
are defined in Chapters 2 and 3.

This chapter discusses certain additional topics that complete the system
programmer's view of the 80386 in real-address mode:

  *  Address formation.
  *  Extensions to registers and instructions.
  *  Interrupt and exception handling.
  *  Entering and leaving real-address mode.
  *  Real-address-mode exceptions.
  *  Differences from 8086.
  *  Differences from 80286 real-address mode.

<A Name="14.1"><H2>14.1  Physical Address Formation</H2>

14.1  Physical Address Formation

The 80386 provides a one Mbyte + 64 Kbyte memory space for an 8086 program.
Segment relocation is performed as in the 8086: the 16-bit value in a
segment selector is shifted left by four bits to form the base address of a
segment. The effective address is extended with four high order zeros and
added to the base to form a linear address as Figure 14-1 illustrates. (The
linear address is equivalent to the physical address, because paging is not
used in real-address mode.) Unlike the 8086, the resulting linear address
may have up to 21 significant bits. There is a possibility of a carry when
the base address is added to the effective address. On the 8086, the carried
bit is truncated, whereas on the 80386 the carried bit is stored in bit
position 20 of the linear address.

Unlike the 8086 and 80286, 32-bit effective addresses can be generated (via
the address-size prefix); however, the value of a 32-bit address may not
exceed 65535 without causing an exception. For full compatibility with 80286
real-address mode, pseudo-protection faults (interrupt 12 or 13 with no
error code) occur if an effective address is generated outside the range 0
through 65535.

<A Name="14.2"><H2>14.2  Registers and Instructions</H2>

14.2  Registers and Instructions

The register set available in real-address mode includes all the registers
defined for the 8086 plus the new registers introduced by the 80386: FS, GS,
debug registers, control registers, and test registers. New instructions
that explicitly operate on the segment registers FS and GS are available,
and the new segment-override prefixes can be used to cause instructions to
utilize FS and GS for address calculations. Instructions can utilize 32-bit
operands through the use of the operand size prefix.

The instruction codes that cause undefined opcode traps (interrupt 6)
include instructions of the protected mode that manipulate or interrogate
80386 selectors and descriptors; namely, VERR, VERW, LAR, LSL, LTR, STR,
LLDT, and SLDT. Programs executing in real-address mode are able to take
advantage of the new applications-oriented instructions added to the
architecture by the introduction of the 80186/80188, 80286 and 80386:

* New instructions introduced by 80186/80188 and 80286.

   -- PUSH immediate data
   -- Push all and pop all (PUSHA and POPA)
   -- Multiply immediate data
   -- Shift and rotate by immediate count
   -- String I/O
   -- ENTER and LEAVE
   -- BOUND

* New instructions introduced by 80386.

   -- LSS, LFS, LGS instructions
   -- Long-displacement conditional jumps
   -- Single-bit instructions
   -- Bit scan
   -- Double-shift instructions
   -- Byte set on condition
   -- Move with sign/zero extension
   -- Generalized multiply
   -- MOV to and from control registers
   -- MOV to and from test registers
   -- MOV to and from debug registers

<A Name="14.3"><H2>14.3  Interrupt and Exception Handling</H2>

14.3  Interrupt and Exception Handling

Interrupts and exceptions in 80386 real-address mode work as much as they
do on an 8086. Interrupts and exceptions vector to interrupt procedures via
an interrupt table. The processor multiplies the interrupt or exception
identifier by four to obtain an index into the interrupt table. The entries
of the interrupt table are far pointers to the entry points of interrupt or
exception handler procedures. When an interrupt occurs, the processor
pushes the current values of CS:IP onto the stack, disables interrupts,
clears TF (the single-step flag), then transfers control to the location
specified in the interrupt table. An IRET instruction at the end of the
handler procedure reverses these steps before returning control to the
interrupted procedure.

The primary difference in the interrupt handling of the 80386 compared to
the 8086 is that the location and size of the interrupt table depend on the
contents of the IDTR (IDT register). Ordinarily, this fact is not apparent
to programmers, because, after RESET, the IDTR contains a base address of 0
and a limit of 3FFH, which is compatible with the 8086. However, the LIDT
instruction can be used in real-address mode to change the base and limit
values in the IDTR. Refer to Chapter 9 for details on the IDTR, and the
LIDT and SIDT instructions. If an interrupt occurs and the corresponding
entry of the interrupt table is beyond the limit stored in the IDTR, the
processor raises exception 8.

<HR>
<A Name="14.4"><H2>14.4  Entering and Leaving Real-Address Mode</H2>

14.4  Entering and Leaving Real-Address Mode

Real-address mode is in effect after a signal on the RESET pin. Even if the
system is going to be used in protected mode, the start-up program will
execute in real-address mode temporarily while initializing for protected
mode.

<HR>
<A Name="14.4.1"><H2>14.4.1  Switching to Protected Mode</H2>

14.4.1  Switching to Protected Mode

The only way to leave real-address mode is to switch to protected mode. The
processor enters protected mode when a MOV to CR0 instruction sets the PE
(protection enable) bit in CR0. (For compatibility with the 80286, the LMSW
instruction may also be used to set the PE bit.)

Refer to Chapter 10 "Initialization" for other aspects of switching to
protected mode.

<HR>
<A Name="14.5"><H2>14.5  Switching Back to Real-Address Mode</H2>

14.5  Switching Back to Real-Address Mode

The processor reenters real-address mode if software clears the PE bit in
CR0 with a MOV to CR0 instruction. A procedure that attempts to do this,
however, should proceed as follows:

  1.  If paging is enabled, perform the following sequence:

      *  Transfer control to linear addresses that have an identity mapping;
         i.e., linear addresses equal physical addresses.

      *  Clear the PG bit in CR0.

      *  Move zeros to CR3 to clear out the paging cache.

  2.  Transfer control to a segment that has a limit of 64K (FFFFH). This
      loads the CS register with the limit it needs to have in real mode.

  3.  Load segment registers SS, DS, ES, FS, and GS with a selector that
      points to a descriptor containing the following values, which are
      appropriate to real mode:

      *  Limit = 64K   (FFFFH)
      *  Byte granular (G = 0)
      *  Expand up     (E = 0)
      *  Writable      (W = 1)
      *  Present       (P = 1)
      *  Base = any value

  4.  Disable interrupts. A CLI instruction disables INTR interrupts. NMIs
      can be disabled with external circuitry.

  5.  Clear the PE bit.

  6.  Jump to the real mode code to be executed using a far JMP. This
      action flushes the instruction queue and puts appropriate values in
      the access rights of the CS register.

  7.  Use the LIDT instruction to load the base and limit of the real-mode
      interrupt vector table.

  8.  Enable interrupts.

  9.  Load the segment registers as needed by the real-mode code.

<A Name="14.6"><H2>14.6  Real-Address Mode Exceptions</H2>

14.6  Real-Address Mode Exceptions

The 80386 reports some exceptions differently when executing in
real-address mode than when executing in protected mode. Table 14-1 details
the real-address-mode exceptions.

<HR>
<A Name="14.7"><H2>14.7  Differences from 8086</H2>

14.7  Differences From 8086

In general, the 80386 in real-address mode will correctly execute ROM-based
software designed for the 8086, 8088, 80186, and 80188. Following is a list
of the minor differences between 8086 execution on the 80386 and on an 8086.

  1.  Instruction clock counts.

      The 80386 takes fewer clocks for most instructions than the 8086/8088.
      The areas most likely to be affected are:

      *  Delays required by I/O devices between I/O operations.

      *  Assumed delays with 8086/8088 operating in parallel with an 8087.

  2.  Divide Exceptions Point to the DIV instruction.

      Divide exceptions on the 80386 always leave the saved CS:IP value
      pointing to the instruction that failed. On the 8086/8088, the CS:IP
      value points to the next instruction.

  3.  Undefined 8086/8088 opcodes.

      Opcodes that were not defined for the 8086/8088 will cause exception
      6 or will execute one of the new instructions defined for the 80386.

  4.  Value written by PUSH SP.

      The 80386 pushes a different value on the stack for PUSH SP than the
      8086/8088. The 80386 pushes the value of SP before SP is incremented
      as part of the push operation; the 8086/8088 pushes the value of SP
      after it is incremented. If the value pushed is important, replace
      PUSH SP instructions with the following three instructions:

      PUSH  BP
      MOV   BP, SP
      XCHG  BP, [BP]

      This code functions as the 8086/8088 PUSH SP instruction on the 80386.

  5.  Shift or rotate by more than 31 bits.

      The 80386 masks all shift and rotate counts to the low-order five
      bits. This MOD 32 operation limits the count to a maximum of 31 bits,
      thereby limiting the time that interrupt response is delayed while
      the instruction is executing.

  6.  Redundant prefixes.

      The 80386 sets a limit of 15 bytes on instruction length. The only
      way to violate this limit is by putting redundant prefixes before an
      instruction. Exception 13 occurs if the limit on instruction length
      is violated. The 8086/8088 has no instruction length limit.

  7.  Operand crossing offset 0 or 65,535.

      On the 8086, an attempt to access a memory operand that crosses
      offset 65,535 (e.g., MOV a word to offset 65,535) or offset 0 (e.g.,
      PUSH a word when SP = 1) causes the offset to wrap around modulo
      65,536. The 80386 raises an exception in these cases--exception 13 if
      the segment is a data segment (i.e., if CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS is being
      used to address the segment), exception 12 if the segment is a stack
      segment (i.e., if SS is being used).

  8.  Sequential execution across offset 65,535.

      On the 8086, if sequential execution of instructions proceeds past
      offset 65,535, the processor fetches the next instruction byte from
      offset 0 of the same segment. On the 80386, the processor raises
      exception 13 in such a case.

  9.  LOCK is restricted to certain instructions.

      The LOCK prefix and its corresponding output signal should only be
      used to prevent other bus masters from interrupting a data movement
      operation. The 80386 always asserts the LOCK signal during an XCHG
      instruction with memory (even if the LOCK prefix is not used). LOCK
      may only be used with the following 80386 instructions when they
      update memory: BTS, BTR, BTC, XCHG, ADD, ADC, SUB, SBB, INC, DEC,
      AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and NEG. An undefined-opcode exception
      (interrupt 6) results from using LOCK before any other instruction.

 10.  Single-stepping external interrupt handlers.

      The priority of the 80386 single-step exception is different from that
      of the 8086/8088. The change prevents an external interrupt handler
      from being single-stepped if the interrupt occurs while a program is
      being single-stepped. The 80386 single-step exception has higher
      priority that any external interrupt. The 80386 will still single-step
      through an interrupt handler invoked by the INT instructions or by an
      exception.

 11.  IDIV exceptions for quotients of 80H or 8000H.

      The 80386 can generate the largest negative number as a quotient for
      the IDIV instruction. The 8086/8088 causes exception zero instead.

 12.  Flags in stack.

      The setting of the flags stored by PUSHF, by interrupts, and by
      exceptions is different from that stored by the 8086 in bit positions
      12 through 15. On the 8086 these bits are stored as ones, but in
      80386 real-address mode bit 15 is always zero, and bits 14 through 12
      reflect the last value loaded into them.

 13.  NMI interrupting NMI handlers.

      After an NMI is recognized on the 80386, the NMI interrupt is masked
      until an IRET instruction is executed.

 14.  Coprocessor errors vector to interrupt 16.

      Any 80386 system with a coprocessor must use interrupt vector 16 for
      the coprocessor error exception. If an 8086/8088 system uses another
      vector for the 8087 interrupt, both vectors should point to the
      coprocessor-error exception handler.

 15.  Numeric exception handlers should allow prefixes.

      On the 80386, the value of CS:IP saved for coprocessor exceptions
      points at any prefixes before an ESC instruction. On 8086/8088
      systems, the saved CS:IP points to the ESC instruction.

 16.  Coprocessor does not use interrupt controller.

      The coprocessor error signal to the 80386 does not pass through an
      interrupt controller (an 8087 INT signal does). Some instructions in
      a coprocessor error handler may need to be deleted if they deal with
      the interrupt controller.

 17.  Six new interrupt vectors.

      The 80386 adds six exceptions that arise only if the 8086 program has
      a hidden bug. It is recommended that exception handlers be added that
      treat these exceptions as invalid operations. This additional
      software does not significantly affect the existing 8086 software
      because the interrupts do not normally occur. These interrupt
      identifiers should not already have been used by the 8086 software,
      because they are in the range reserved by Intel. Table 14-2 describes
      the new 80386 exceptions.

 18.  One megabyte wraparound.

      The 80386 does not wrap addresses at 1 megabyte in real-address mode.
      On members of the 8086 family, it possible to specify addresses
      greater than one megabyte.  For example, with a selector value 0FFFFH
      and an offset of 0FFFFH, the effective address would be 10FFEFH (1
      Mbyte + 65519).  The 8086, which can form adresses only up to 20 bits
      long, truncates the high-order bit, thereby "wrapping" this address
      to 0FFEFH.  However, the 80386, which can form addresses up to 32
      bits long does not truncate such an address.

14.8  Differences From 80286 Real-Address Mode

The few differences that exist between 80386 real-address mode and 80286
real-address mode are not likely to affect any existing 80286 programs
except possibly the system initialization procedures.

<HR>
<A Name="14.8.1"><H2>14.8.1  Bus Lock</H2>

14.8.1  Bus Lock

The 80286 processor implements the bus lock function differently than the
80386. Programs that use forms of memory locking specific to the 80286 may
not execute properly if transported to a specific application of the 80386.

The LOCK prefix and its corresponding output signal should only be used to
prevent other bus masters from interrupting a data movement operation.  LOCK
may only be used with the following 80386 instructions when they modify
memory.  An undefined-opcode exception results from using LOCK before any
other instruction.

  *  Bit test and change:  BTS, BTR, BTC.
  *  Exchange: XCHG.
  *  One-operand arithmetic and logical: INC, DEC, NOT, and NEG.
  *  Two-operand arithmetic and logical: ADD, ADC, SUB, SBB, AND, OR, XOR.

A locked instruction is guaranteed to lock only the area of memory defined
by the destination operand, but may lock a larger memory area.  For example,
typical 8086 and 80286 configurations lock the entire physical memory space.
With the 80386, the defined area of memory is guranteed to be locked against
access by a processor executing a locked instruction on exactly the same
memory area, i.e., an operand with identical starting address and identical
length.

<A Name="14.8.2"><H2>14.8.2  Location of First Instruction</H2>

14.8.2  Location of First Instruction

The starting location is 0FFFFFFF0H (sixteen bytes from end of 32-bit
address space) on the 80386 rather than 0FFFFF0H (sixteen bytes from end of
24-bit address space) as on the 80286.  Many 80286 ROM initialization
programs will work correctly in this new environment.  Others can be made to
work correctly with external hardware that redefines the signals on
A{31-20}.

<HR>
<A Name="14.8.3"><H2>14.8.3  Initial Values of General Registers</H2>

14.8.3  Initial Values of General Registers

On the 80386, certain general registers may contain different values after
RESET than on the 80286. This should not cause compatibility problems,
because the content of 8086 registers after RESET is undefined.  If
self-test is requested during the reset sequence and errors are detected in
the 80386 unit, EAX will contain a nonzero value. EDX contains the component
and revision identifier. Refer to Chapter 10 for more information.


<HR>
<A Name="14.8.4"><H2>14.8.4  MSW Initialization</H2>


14.8.4  MSW Initialization

The 80286 initializes the MSW register to FFF0H, but the 80386 initializes
this register to 0000H. This difference should have no effect, because the
bits that are different are undefined on the 80286.  Programs that read the
value of the MSW will behave differently on the 80386 only if they depend on
the setting of the undefined, high-order bits.
