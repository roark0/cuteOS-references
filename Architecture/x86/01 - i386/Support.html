Customer Support is Intel's complete support service that provides Intel
customers with hardware support, software support, customer training, and
consulting services. For more information contact your local sales offices.

After a customer purchases any system hardware or software product,
service and support become major factors in determining whether that
product will continue to meet a customer's expectations. Such support
requires an international support organization and a breadth of programs
to meet a variety of customer needs. As you might expect, Intel's customer
support is quite extensive. It includes factory repair services and
worldwide field service offices providing hardware repair services,
software support services, customer training classes, and consulting
services.
