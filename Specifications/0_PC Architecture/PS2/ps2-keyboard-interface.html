<a name="Abstract"></a><h2> Abstract </h2>
<p>This article tries to cover every aspect of AT and PS/2 keyboards.
It includes information on the low-level signals and protocol, scan
codes, the command set, initialization, compatibility issues, and other
miscellaneous information. Since it's closely related, I've also
included information on the PC keyboard controller. All code samples
involving the keyboard encoder are written in assembly for Microchip's
PIC microcontrollers. All code samples related to the keyboard
controller are written in x86 assembly
</p>
<a name="A_History_Lesson"></a><h2> A History Lesson </h2>
<p>The most popular keyboards in use today include: 
</p>
<ul><li>USB keyboard - Latest keyboard supported by all new computers
(Macintosh and IBM/compatible). These are relatively complicated to
interface and are not covered in this article. </li><li>IBM/Compatible keyboards - Also known as "AT keyboards" or
"PS/2 keyboards", all modern PCs support this device. They're the
easiest to interface, and are the subject of this article. </li><li>ADB keyboards - Connect to the Apple Desktop Bus of older Macintosh systems.  These are not covered in this article 
</li></ul>
<p>IBM introduced a new keyboard with each of its major desktop
computer models. The original IBM PC, and later the IBM XT, used what
we call the "XT keyboard." These are obsolete and differ significantly
from modern keyboards; the XT keyboard is not covered in this article.
Next came the IBM AT system and later the IBM PS/2. They introduced the
keyboards we use today, and are the topic of this article. AT keyboards
and PS/2 keyboards were very similar devices, but the PS/2 device used
a smaller connector and supported a few additional features.
Nonetheless, it remained backward compatible with AT systems and few of
the additional features ever caught on (since software also wanted to
remain backward compatible.) Below is a summary of IBM's three major
keyboards. </p><p>IBM PC/XT Keyboard (1981): 
</p>
<ul><li>83 keys 
</li><li>5-pin DIN connector 
</li><li>Simple uni-directional serial protocol 
</li><li>Uses what we now refer to as scan code set 1 
</li><li>No host-to-keyboard commands 
</li></ul>
<p>IBM AT Keyboard (1984) - Not backward compatible with XT systems(1). 
</p>
<ul><li>84 -101 keys 
</li><li>5-pin DIN connector 
</li><li>Bi-directional serial protocol 
</li><li>Uses what we now refer to as scan code set 2 
</li><li>Eight host-to-keyboard commands 
</li></ul>
<p>IBM PS/2 Keyboard (1987) - Compatible with AT systems, not compatible with XT systems(1). 
</p>
<ul><li>84 - 101 keys 
</li><li>6-pin mini-DIN connector 
</li><li>Bi-direction serial protocol 
</li><li>Offers optional scan code set 3 
</li><li>17 host-to-keyboard commands  
</li></ul>
<p>The PS/2 keyboard was originally an extension of the AT device. It
supported a few additional host-to-keyboard commands and featured a
smaller connector. These were the only differences between the two
devices. However, computer hardware has never been about standards as
much as compatibility. For this reason, any keyboard you buy today will
be compatible with PS/2 and AT systems, but it may not fully support
all the features of the original devices. Today, "AT keyboard" and
"PS/2 keyboard" refers only to their connector size. Which
settings/commands any given keyboard does or does not support is
anyone's guess. For example, the keyboard I'm using right now has a
PS/2-style connector but only fully supports seven commands, partially
supports two, and merely "acknowledges" the rest. In contrast, my
"Test" keyboard has an AT-style connector but supports every
feature/command of the original PS/2 device (plus a few extra.) It's
important you treat modern keyboards as compatible, not standard. If
your design a keyboard-related device that relies on non-general
features, it may work on some systems, but not on others... </p><p>Modern PS/2 (AT) compatible keyboards:
</p>
<ul><li>Any number of keys (usually 101 or 104) 
</li><li>5-pin or 6-pin connector; adaptor usually included 
</li><li>Bi-directional serial protocol 
</li><li>Only scan code set 2 guaranteed. 
</li><li>Acknowledges all commands; may not act on all of them. 
</li></ul>
<p>Footnote 1) XT keyboards use a completely different protocol than
that used by AT and PS/2 systems, making it incompatible with the newer
PCs. However, there was a transition period where some keyboard
controllers supported both XT and AT (PS/2) keyboards (through a
switch, jumper, or auto-sense.) Also, some keyboards were made to work
on both types of systems (again, through the use of a switch or
auto-sensing.) If you've owned such a PC or keyboard, don't let it fool
you--XT keyboards are NOT compatible with modern computers. </p>
<a name="General_Description"></a><h2> General Description </h2>
<p>Keyboards consist of a large matrix of keys, all of which are
monitored by an on-board processor (called the "keyboard encoder".) The
specific processor(1) varies from keyboard-to-keyboard but they all
basically do the same thing: Monitor which key(s) are being
pressed/released and send the appropriate data to the host. This
processor takes care of all the debouncing and buffers any data in its
16-byte buffer, if needed. Your motherboard contains a "keyboard
controller"(2) that is in charge of decoding all of the data received
from the keyboard and informing your software of what's going on. All
communication between the host and the keyboard uses an IBM protocol. </p><p>Footnote 1) Originally, IBM used the Intel 8048
microcontroller as its keyboard encoder. There are now a wide variety
of keyboard encoder chips available from many different manufacturers. </p><p>Footnote 2) Originally, IBM used the Intel 8042
microcontroller as its keyboard controller. This has since been
replaces with compatible devices integrated in motherboards' chipsets.
The keyboard controller is covered later in this article. </p>
<a name="Electrical_Interface_.2F_Protocol"></a><h2> Electrical Interface / Protocol </h2>
<p>The AT and PS/2 keyboards use the same protocol as the PS/2 mouse.  Click <a href="http://www.computer-engineering.org/index.php?title=PS/2_Mouse/Keyboard_Protocol" title="PS/2 Mouse/Keyboard Protocol">here</a> for detailed information on this protocol.
</p>
<a name="Scan_Codes"></a><h2> Scan Codes </h2>
<p>Your keyboard's processor spends most of its time "scanning", or
monitoring, the matrix of keys. If it finds that any key is being
pressed, released, or held down, the keyboard will send a packet of
information known as a "scan code" to your computer. There are two
different types of scan codes: "make codes" and "break codes". A make
code is sent when a key is pressed or held down. A break code is sent
when a key is released. Every key is assigned its own unique make code
and break code so the host can determine exactly what happened to which
key by looking at a single scan code. The set of make and break codes
for every key comprises a "scan code set". There are three standard
scan code sets, named one, two, and three. All modern keyboards default
to set two.(1) </p><p>So how do you figure out what the scan codes are for each key?
Unfortunately, there's no simple formula for calculating this. If you
want to know what the make code or break code is for a specific key,
you'll have to look it up in a table. I've composed tables for all make
codes and break codes in all three scan code sets: </p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.computer-engineering.org/index.php?title=Scan_Code_Set_1&amp;action=edit" class="new" title="Scan Code Set 1">Scan Code Set 1</a> - Original XT scan code set; supported by some modern keyboards 
</li><li><a href="http://www.computer-engineering.org/index.php?title=Scan_Code_Set_2&amp;action=edit" class="new" title="Scan Code Set 2">Scan Code Set 2</a> - Default scan code set for all modern keyboards 
</li><li><a href="http://www.computer-engineering.org/index.php?title=Scan_Code_Set_3&amp;action=edit" class="new" title="Scan Code Set 3">Scan Code Set 3</a> - Optional PS/2 scan code set, rarely used 
</li></ul>
<p>Footnote 1) Originally, the AT keyboard only supported set two, and
the PS/2 keyboard would default to set two but supported all three.
Most modern keyboards behave like the PS/2 device, but I have come
across a few that didn't support set one, set three, or both. Also, if
you've ever done any low-level PC programming, you've probably notice
the keyboard controller supplies set ONE scan codes by default. This is
because the keyboard controller converts all incomming scan codes to
set one (this stems from retaining compatibility with software written
for XT systems.) However, it's still set two scan codes being sent down
the keyboard's serial line. </p>
<a name="Make_Codes.2C_Break_Codes.2C_and_Typematic_Repeat"></a><h2> Make Codes, Break Codes, and Typematic Repeat </h2>
<p>Whenever a key is pressed, that key's make code is sent to the
computer. Keep in mind that a make code only represents a key on a
keyboard--it does not represent the character printed on that key. This
means that there is no defined relationship between a make code and an
ASCII code. It's up to the host to translate scan codes to characters
or commands. </p><p>Although most set two make codes are only one-byte wide, there
are a handfull of "extended keys" whose make codes are two or four
bytes wide. These make codes can be identified by the fact that their
first byte is E0h. </p><p>Just as a make code is sent to the computer whenever a key is
pressed, a break code is sent whenever a key is released. In addition
to every key having its own unique make code, they all have their own
unique break code(1). Fortunately, however, you won't always have to
use lookup tables to figure out a key's break code--certain
relationships do exist between make codes and break codes. Most set two
break codes are two bytes long where the first byte is F0h and the
second byte is the make code for that key. Break codes for extended
keys are usually three bytes long where the first two bytes are E0h,
F0h, and the last byte is the last byte of that key's make code. As an
example, I have listed below a the set two make codes and break codes
for a few keys: </p><p><br>
</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tbody><tr>
<th> Key </th><th> Make Code </th><th> Break Code
</th></tr>
<tr>
<td> "A" </td><td> 1C </td><td> F0,1C
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> "5" </td><td> 2E </td><td> F0,2E
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> "F10" </td><td> 09 </td><td> F0,09
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Right Arrow </td><td> E0,74 </td><td> E0,F0,74
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Right Ctrl </td><td> E0,14 </td><td> E0,F0,14
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Example: What sequence of make codes and break codes should be sent
to your computer for the character "G" to appear in a word processor?
Since this is an upper-case letter, the sequence of events that need to
take place are: press the "Shift" key, press the "G" key, release the
"G" key, release the "Shift" key. The scan codes associated with these
events are the following: make code for the "Shift" key (12h), make
code for the "G" key (34h), break code for the "G" key(F0h,34h), break
code for the "Shift" key (F0h,12h). Therefore, the data sent to your
computer would be: 12h, 34h, F0h, 34h, F0h, 12h.
</p><p>If you press a key, its make code is sent to the computer. When
you press and hold down a key, that key becomes typematic, which means
the keyboard will keep sending that key's make code until the key is
released or another key is pressed. To verify this, open a text editor
and hold down the "A" key. When you first press the key, the character
"a" immediately appears on your screen. After a short delay, another
"a" will appear followed by a whole stream of "a"s until you release
the "A" key. There are two important parameters here: the typematic
delay, which is the short delay between the first and second "a", and
the typematic rate, which is how many characters per second will appear
on your screen after the typematic delay. The typematic delay can range
from 0.25 seconds to 1.00 second and the typematic rate can range from
2.0 cps (characters per second) to 30.0 cps. You may change the
typematic rate and delay using the "Set Typematic Rate/Delay" (0xF3)
command. </p><p>Typematic data is not buffered within the keyboard. In the
case where more than one key is held down, only the last key pressed
becomes typematic. Typematic repeat then stops when that key is
released, even though other keys may be held down. </p><p>Footnote 1) Actually, the "Pause/Break" key does not have a
break code in scan code sets one and two. When this key is pressed, its
make code is sent; when it's released, it doesn't send anything. So how
do you tell when this key has been released? You can't.
</p>
<a name="Reset"></a><h2> Reset </h2>
<p>At power-on or software reset (see the "Reset" command) the keyboard
performs a diagnostic self-test referred to as BAT (Basic Assurance
Test) and loads the following default values: </p>
<ul><li>Typematic delay 500 ms. 
</li><li>Typematic rate 10.9 cps. 
</li><li>Scan code set 2. 
</li><li>Set all keys typematic/make/break. 
</li></ul>
<p>When entering BAT, the keyboard enables its three LED indicators,
and turns them off when BAT has completed. At this time, a BAT
completion code of either 0xAA (BAT successful) or 0xFC (Error) is sent
to the host. This BAT completion code must be sent 500~750 milliseconds
after power-on. </p><p>Many of the keyboards I've tested ignore their CLOCK and DATA
lines until after the BAT completion code has been sent. Therefore, an
"Inhibit" condition (CLOCK line low) may not prevent the keyboard from
sending its BAT completion code.
</p>
<a name="Command_Set"></a><h2> Command Set </h2>
<p>A few notes regarding commands the host can issue to the keyboard:
</p>
<ul><li>The keyboard clears its output buffer when it recieves any command. 
</li><li>If the keyboard receives an invalid command or argument, it must respond with "resend" (0xFE). 
</li><li>The keyboard must not send any scancodes while processing a command. 
</li><li>If the keyboard is waiting for an argument byte and it instead
receives a command, it should discard the previous command and process
this new one. </li></ul>
<p>Below are all the commands the host may send to the keyboard:
</p>
<ul><li>0xFF (Reset) - Keyboard responds with "ack" (0xFA), then enters "Reset" mode.  (See "Reset" section.) 
</li><li>0xFE (Resend) - Keyboard responds by resending the last-sent
byte. The exception to this is if the last-sent byte was "resend"
(0xFE). If this is the case, the keyboard resends the last non-0xFE
byte. This command is used by the host to indicate an error in
reception. </li></ul>
<p>The next six commands can be issued when the keyboard is in any
mode, but it only effects the behavior of the keyboard when in "mode 3"
(ie, set to scan code set 3.) </p>
<ul><li>0xFD (Set Key Type Make) - Disable break codes and typematic
repeat for specified keys. Keyboard responds with "ack" (0xFA), then
disables scanning (if enabled) and reads a list of keys from the host.
These keys are specified by their set 3 make codes. Keyboard responds
to each make code with "ack". Host terminates this list by sending an
invalid set 3 make code (eg, a valid command.) The keyboard then
re-enables scanning (if previously disabled). </li><li>0xFC (Set Key Type Make/Break) - Similar to previous command, except this one only disables typematic repeat. 
</li><li>0xFB (Set Key Type Typematic) - Similar to previous two, except this one only disables break codes. 
</li><li>0xFA (Set All Keys Typematic/Make/Break) - Keyboard responds
with "ack" (0xFA). Sets all keys to their normal setting (generate scan
codes on make, break, and typematic repeat) </li><li>0xF9 (Set All Keys Make) - Keyboard responds with "ack" (0xFA).  Similar to 0xFD, except applies to all keys. 
</li><li>0xF8 (Set All Keys Make/Break) - Keyboard responds with "ack" (0xFA).  Similar to 0xFC, except applies to all keys. 
</li><li>0xF7 (Set All Keys Typematic) - Keyboard responds with "ack" (0xFA).  Similar to 0xFB, except applies to all keys. 
</li><li>0xF6 (Set Default) - Load default typematic rate/delay
(10.9cps / 500ms), key types (all keys typematic/make/break), and scan
code set (2). </li><li>0xF5 (Disable) - Keyboard stops scanning, loads default values (see "Set Default" command), and waits further instructions. 
</li><li>0xF4 (Enable) - Re-enables keyboard after disabled using previous command. 
</li><li>0xF3 (Set Typematic Rate/Delay) - Host follows this command
with one argument byte that defines the typematic rate and delay as
follows: </li></ul>
