<p>This document describes the interface used by the PS/2 mouse, PS/2
keyboard, and AT keyboard. I'll cover the physical and electrical
interface, as well as the protocol. If you need higher-level
information, such as commands, data packet formats, or other
information specific to the keyboard or mouse, I have written separate
documents for the two devices: </p>

<a name="The_Physical_Interface"></a><h2> The Physical Interface </h2>
<p>The physical PS/2 port is one of two styles of connectors: The 5-pin
DIN or the 6-pin mini-DIN. Both connectors are completely
(electrically) similar; the only practical difference between the two
is the arrangement of pins. This means the two types of connectors can
easily be changed with simple hard-wired adaptors. These cost about $6
each or you can make your own by matching the pins on any two
connectors. The DIN standard was created by the German Standardization
Organization (Deutsches Institut fuer Norm) . Their <a href="http://www.din.de/" class="external text" title="http://www.din.de" rel="nofollow">website</a> is at (this site is in German, but most of their pages are also available in English.) 
</p><p>PC keyboards use either a 6-pin mini-DIN or a 5-pin DIN
connector. If your keyboard has a 6-pin mini-DIN and your computer has
a 5-pin DIN (or visa versa), the two can be made compatible with the
adaptors described above. Keyboards with the 6-pin mini-DIN are often
referred to as "PS/2" keyboards, while those with the 5-pin DIN are
called "AT" devices ("XT" keyboards also used the 5-pin DIN, but they
are quite old and haven't been made for many years.) All modern
keyboards built for the PC are either PS/2, AT, USB, or Bluetooth. This
document does not apply to USB or Bluetooth devices, which use
completely different interfaces. </p><p>Mice come in a number of shapes and sizes (and interfaces.)
The most popular type is probably the PS/2 mouse, with USB mice gaining
popularity. Just a few years ago, serial mice were also quite popular,
but the computer industry is abandoning them in support of USB and PS/2
devices. This document applies only to PS/2 mice. If you want to
interface a serial or USB mouse, there's plenty of information
available elsewhere on the web.
</p><p>The cable connecting the keyboard/mouse to the computer is
usually about six feet long and consists of four to six 26 AWG wires
surrounded by a thin layer of mylar foil sheilding. If you need a
longer cable, you can buy PS/2 extenstion cables from most consumer
electronics stores. You should not connect multiple extension cables
together. If you need a 30-foot keyboard cable, buy a 30-foot keyboard
cable. Do not simply connect five 6-foot cables together. Doing so
could result in poor communication between the keyboard/mouse and the
host.
</p><p>As a side note, there is one other type of connector you may
run into on keyboards. While most keyboard cables are hard-wired to the
keyboard, there are some whose cable is not permanently attached and
come as a separate component. These cables have a DIN connector on one
end (the end that connects to the computer) and a Shielded Data Link
(SDL) connector on the keyboard end. SDL was created by a company
called "AMP." This connector is somewhat similar to a telephone
connector in that it has wires and springs rather than pins, and a clip
holds it in place. If you need more information on this connector, you
might be able to find it on AMP's <a href="http://www.amp.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.amp.com" rel="nofollow">website</a>.
Don't confuse the SDL connector with the USB connector--they probably
both look similar in my diagram below, but they are actually very
different. Keep in mind that the SDL connector has springs and moving
parts, while the USB connector does not. </p><p>The pinouts for each connector are shown below:

<p>Note: Throughout this document, I will use the more general term
"host" to refer to the computer--or whatever the keyboard/mouse is
connected to-- and the term "device" will refer to the keyboard/mouse. </p><p>Vcc/Ground provide power to the keyboard/mouse. The keyboard
or mouse should not draw more than 275 mA from the host and care must
be taken to avoid transient surges. Such surges can be caused by
"hot-plugging" a keyboard/mouse (ie, connect/disconnect the device
while the computer's power is on.) Older motherboards had a
surface-mounted fuse protecting the keyboard and mouse ports. When this
fuse blew, the motherboard was useless to the consumer, and non-fixable
to the average technician. Most newer motherboards use auto-reset
"Poly" fuses that go a long way to remedy this problem. However, this
is not a standard and there's still plenty of older motherboards in
use. Therefore, I recommend against hot-plugging a PS/2 mouse or
keyboard.

<p>The Data and Clock lines are both open-collector with pullup
resistors to Vcc. An "open-collector" interface has two possible state:
low, or high impedance. In the "low" state, a transistor pulls the line
to ground level. In the "high impedance" state, the interface acts as
an open circuit and doesn't drive the line low or high. Furthermore, a
"pullup" resistor is connected between the bus and Vcc so the bus is
pulled high if none of the devices on the bus are actively pulling it
low. The exact value of this resistor isn't too important (1~10 kOhms);
larger resistances result in less power consumption and smaller
resistances result in a faster rise time. A general open-collector
interface is shown below:
</p><p>Figure 1: General open-collector interface. Data and Clock are
read on the microcontroller's pins A and B, respectively. Both lines
are normally held at +5V, but can be pulled to ground by asserting
logic "1" on C and D. As a result, Data equals D, inverted, and Clock
equals C, inverted.
</p><p><br>
<a href="http://www.computer-engineering.org/index.php?title=Image:OpenCollector.jpg" class="image" title="Open-collector interface"><img src="ps2-keyboard-protocol_files/OpenCollector.jpg" alt="Open-collector interface" longdesc="/index.php?title=Image:OpenCollector.jpg" height="330" width="352"></a>
</p><p><br>Note: When looking through examples on this website, you'll
notice I use a few tricks when implementing an open-collector interface
with PIC microcontrollers. I use the same pin for both input and
output, and I enable the PIC's internal pullup resistors rather than
using external resistors. A line is pulled to ground by setting the
corresponding pin to output, and writing a "zero" to that port. The
line is set to the "high impedance" state by setting the pin to input.
</p>
<a name="Communication:_General_Description"></a><h2> Communication: General Description </h2>
<p>The PS/2 mouse and keyboard implement a bidirectional synchronous
serial protocol. The bus is "idle" when both lines are high
(open-collector). This is the only state where the keyboard/mouse is
allowed begin transmitting data. The host has ultimate control over the
bus and may inhibit communication at any time by pulling the Clock line
low. </p><p>The device always generates the clock signal. If the host
wants to send data, it must first inhibit communication from the device
by pulling Clock low. The host then pulls Data low and releases Clock.
This is the "request-to-Send" state and signals the device to start
generating clock pulses.

<p><br>
All data is transmitted one byte at a time and each byte is sent in a frame consisting of 11-12 bits.  These bits are: 
</p>
<ul><li>1 start bit.  This is always 0. 
</li><li>8 data bits, least significant bit first. 
</li><li>1 parity bit (odd parity). 
</li><li>1 stop bit.  This is always 1. 
</li><li>1 acknowledge bit (host-to-device communication only) 
</li></ul>
<p>The parity bit is set (1) if there is an even number of 1's in the
data bits and reset (0) if there is an odd number of 1's in the data
bits. The number of 1's in the data bits plus the parity bit always add
up to an odd number (odd parity). This is used for error detection. The
keyboard/mouse must check this bit and if incorrect it should respond
as if it had received an invalid command.
</p><p>Data sent from the device to the host is read on the falling
edge of the clock signal; data sent from the host to the device is read
on the rising edge. The clock frequency must be in the range 10 - 16.7
kHz. This means clock must be high for 30 - 50 microseconds and low for
30 - 50 microseconds.. If you're designing a keyboard, mouse, or host
emulator, you should modify/sample the Data line in the middle of each
cell. I.e. 15 - 25 microseconds after the appropriate clock transition.
Again, the keyboard/mouse always generates the clock signal, but the
host always has ultimate control over communication. </p><p>Timing is absolutely crucial.  Every time quantity I give in this article must be followed exactly.
</p>
<a name="Communication:_Device-to-Host"></a><h2> Communication: Device-to-Host </h2>
<p>The Data and Clock lines are both open collector. A resistor is
connected between each line and +5V, so the idle state of the bus is
high. When the keyboard or mouse wants to send information, it first
checks the Clock line to make sure it's at a high logic level. If it's
not, the host is inhibiting communication and the device must buffer
any to-be-sent data until the host releases Clock. The Clock line must
be continuously high for at least 50 microseconds before the device can
begin to transmit its data. </p><p>As I mentioned in the previous section, the keyboard and mouse use a serial protocol with 11-bit frames.  These bits are: 
</p>
<ul><li>1 start bit.  This is always 0. 
</li><li>8 data bits, least significant bit first. 
</li><li>1 parity bit (odd parity). 
</li><li>1 stop bit.  This is always 1. 
</li></ul>
<p>The keyboard/mouse writes a bit on the Data line when Clock is high,
and it is read by the host when Clock is low. Figures 2 and 3
illustrate this.
</p><p>Figure 2: Device-to-host Communication. The Data line changes
state when Clock is high and that data is valid when Clock is low. </p><p><a href="http://www.computer-engineering.org/index.php?title=Image:Waveform1.jpg" class="image" title="Device-to-host Communication"><img src="ps2-keyboard-protocol_files/Waveform1.jpg" alt="Device-to-host Communication" longdesc="/index.php?title=Image:Waveform1.jpg" height="139" width="432"></a> 
</p><p>Figure 3: Scan code for the "Q" key (15h) being sent from a
keyboard to the computer. Channel A is the Clock signal; channel B is
the Data signal. </p><p><a href="http://www.computer-engineering.org/index.php?title=Image:Waveform2.jpg" class="image" title="Device-to-host Example"><img src="ps2-keyboard-protocol_files/Waveform2.jpg" alt="Device-to-host Example" longdesc="/index.php?title=Image:Waveform2.jpg" height="255" width="386"></a>
</p><p><br>
The clock frequency is 10-16.7 kHz. The time from the rising edge of a
clock pulse to a Data transition must be at least 5 microseconds. The
time from a data transition to the falling edge of a clock pulse must
be at least 5 microseconds and no greater than 25 microseconds. </p><p>The host may inhibit communication at any time by pulling the
Clock line low for at least 100 microseconds. If a transmission is
inhibited before the 11th clock pulse, the device must abort the
current transmission and prepare to retransmit the current "chunk" of
data when host releases Clock. A "chunk" of data could be a make code,
break code, device ID, mouse movement packet, etc. For example, if a
keyboard is interrupted while sending the second byte of a two-byte
break code, it will need to retransmit both bytes of that break code,
not just the one that was interrupted.
</p><p>If the host pulls clock low before the first high-to-low clock
transition, or after the falling edge of the last clock pulse, the
keyboard/mouse does not need to retransmit any data. However, if new
data is created that needs to be transmitted, it will have to be
buffered until the host releases Clock. Keyboards have a 16-byte buffer
for this purpose. If more than 16 bytes worth of keystrokes occur,
further keystrokes will be ignored until there's room in the buffer.
Mice only store the most current movement packet for transmission.
</p>
<a name="Communication:_Host-to-Device"></a><h2> Communication: Host-to-Device </h2>
<p>The packet is sent a little differently in host-to-device communication... 
</p><p>First of all, the PS/2 device always generates the clock signal.
If the host wants to send data, it must first put the Clock and Data
lines in a "Request-to-send" state as follows: </p>
<ul><li>Inhibit communication by pulling Clock low for at least 100 microseconds. 
</li><li>Apply "Request-to-send" by pulling Data low, then release Clock. 
</li></ul>
<p>The device should check for this state at intervals not to exceed 10
milliseconds. When the device detects this state, it will begin
generating Clock signals and clock in eight data bits and one stop bit.
The host changes the Data line only when the Clock line is low, and
data is read by the device when Clock is high. This is opposite of what
occours in device-to-host communication. </p><p>After the stop bit is received, the device will acknowledge
the received byte by bringing the Data line low and generating one last
clock pulse. If the host does not release the Data line after the 11th
clock pulse, the device will continue to generate clock pulses until
the the Data line is released (the device will then generate an error.)
</p><p>The host may abort transmission at time before the 11th clock
pulse (acknowledge bit) by holding Clock low for at least 100
microseconds. </p><p>To make this process a little easier to understand, here's the steps the host must follow to send data to a PS/2 device: 
</p>
<ol><li> Bring the Clock line low for at least 100 microseconds. 
</li><li> Bring the Data line low. 
</li><li> Release the Clock line. 
</li><li> Wait for the device to bring the Clock line low. 
</li><li> Set/reset the Data line to send the first data bit 
</li><li> Wait for the device to bring Clock high. 
</li><li> Wait for the device to bring Clock low. 
</li><li> Repeat steps 5-7 for the other seven data bits and the parity bit 
</li><li> Release the Data line. 
</li><li> Wait for the device to bring Data low. 
</li><li> Wait for the device to bring Clock  low. 
</li><li> Wait for the device to release Data and Clock
</li></ol>
<p>Figure 3 shows this graphically and Figure 4 separates the timing to
show which signals are generated by the host, and which are generated
by the PS/2 device. Notice the change in timing for the "ack" bit--the
data transition occours when the Clock line is high (rather than when
it is low as is the case for the other 11 bits.) </p><p>Figure 3:  Host-to-Device Communication. 
</p><p><a href="http://www.computer-engineering.org/index.php?title=Image:Waveform3.jpg" class="image" title="Host-to-Device Communication"><img src="ps2-keyboard-protocol_files/Waveform3.jpg" alt="Host-to-Device Communication" longdesc="/index.php?title=Image:Waveform3.jpg" height="131" width="504"></a>

</p><p>Referring to Figure 4, there's two time quantities the host
looks for. (a) is the time it takes the device to begin generating
clock pulses after the host initially takes the Clock line low, which
must be no greater than 15 ms. (b) is the time it takes for the packet
to be sent, which must be no greater than 2ms. If either of these time
limits is not met, the host should generate an error. Immediately after
the "ack" is received, the host may bring the Clock line low to inhibit
communication while it processes data. If the command sent by the host
requires a response, that response must be received no later than 20 ms
after the host releases the Clock line. If this does not happen, the
host generates an error.
